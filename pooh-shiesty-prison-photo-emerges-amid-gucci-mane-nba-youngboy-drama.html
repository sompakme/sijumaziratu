Prior to his arrest, Shiesty was considered one of the brightest stars in the Memphis hip-hop scene.</p><p>The rapper could face up to 20 years in prison, but prosecutors are expected to recommend a sentence of around 8 years for the crimes in question.</p><p>Shiesty first made a splash in January 2021 when his mixtape Shiesty Season dropped.
