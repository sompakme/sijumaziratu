But a new kind of bond with the king isn't the only thing that she's building. According to sources close to the royals, Kate is also helping to heal a rift between her husband,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Prince William</a>, and his father. The Princess of Wales is reportedly bringing William and his dad closer together after multiple reports that their relationship "hasn't always been the easiest."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Royal expert Victoria Arbiter told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Mirror</a>&nbsp;that Kate is a "healing balm" for the family and has been vital in bringing father and son closer together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think we can look at Kate — she’s so close to her own family, family is so important to her. [Kate] has been a really wonderful healing balm for Prince William and his father, as well," Arbiter explained. "Because that relationship hasn't always been the easiest."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think she's just managed to bring a real sense of warmth and camaraderie and family to the royal family," she added before noting that Kate and Charles would naturally bond over their battles with cancer and that they "would have found tremendous comfort in each other, going through something so similar."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Sunday Times</a>&nbsp;added that since both Kate and Charles were in the London Clinic together earlier this year, the king "toddled" down to visit her.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Aaron Chown/PA Wire</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Charles also reportedly had a strong reaction to Kate's video message, during which she shared news of her preventative chemotherapy with the world. Sources shared that the day before the message was posted by Buckingham Palace, the king and Kate had a special lunch together.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The king left his lunch feeling very emotional," a source told&nbsp;The<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Sun. "They are very close and he thinks of Catherine as his daughter. There is no doubt there is a lot they can share and can use each other for support during their own deeply personal cancer battles."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The king issued a statement shortly after Kate's, saying that he was&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>"proud"</a>&nbsp;of her. In a statement shared with the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>BBC</a>, the palace said that Charles is "so proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking as she did" and remains in "closest contact with his beloved daughter-in-law."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57ypqrnmWdnrGluMStpqdlm567qHnCoZirpJWoerG%2ByKeanmWnnrmttcCmZKuhlql6eYKRbGdyaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
