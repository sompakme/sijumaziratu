Its not my fault she’s straight.”</p><p>Shotzi said she would legitimately marry Brandi Lauren, except that Brandi is straight. Lauren replied, noting that Shotzi is the only girl she wants to spend the rest of her life with. The fan responded, calling them “Shotzren.” Shotzi said she prefers the name “Branzi.”</p><p>The original controversy stemmed from Bill Bhatti, who claimed that the couple pretending to be in a relationship was seen as immature backstage. In reality, WWE sources said that it was a complete non-story and fake news. Shotzi and Brandi’s continued playfulness confirms that.</p><p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with a couple of best pals having some fun together. There would have been no reason for any heat from anyone at WWE unless there was a massive overreaction. Regardless of the reports, Shozi Blackheart and Brandi Lauren are just two friends enjoying themselves and joking around on social media.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>What do you think of this story?
