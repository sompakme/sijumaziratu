In court papers exclusively obtained by The Sun, Angelina, 36, and Chris, 42, finalized their divorce on May 29, but despite that, they are still duking it out in court because he claims his reality star ex still owes him money. 
A New Jersey judge finalized the divorce with Chris and his attorney present in court, while Angelina's attorney filed an affidavit in lieu of appearance- meaning she agreed to the terms of the uncontested divorce without being present."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Wife is employed by 495 Productions&nbsp;and is a TV reality&nbsp;star with additional&nbsp;businesses and promotions. Wife's salary far exceeds the husband's," the lawyer argued. &nbsp;</p><p>Beyond Angelina's alleged ability to pay for Chris' attorney's fees, the lawyer also argued that she should because of the "unreasonable position she has taken to refuse to abide by the terms of the party's duly executed marital settlement agreement."&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>His lawyer said they even tried to assist Angelina by offering a resolution where she could pay Chris out of the sale of <a href=#>their marital home, which they owned 50/50</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of the lawyer's fees, Chris wants Angelina penalized $50 a day for every day she has not given him the $22,000 for his share of their wedding gifts. &nbsp;</p><h2>THE MARITAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT&nbsp;</h2><p>Angelina and Chris' marital settlement agreement, which was included in the public record in June when Chris filed his motion to enforce Angelina to pay him the alleged outstanding $22,000, has some interesting points. &nbsp;</p><p>The former married couple made sure to include who gets which pet in the event of a divorce. &nbsp;</p><p>"Angelina has one dog which is Angelina's separate property. The parties agree that Angelina shall retain the dog Peanut. Chris will retain two of the cats, while Angelina shall retain the other two cats."&nbsp;</p><p>There is also a reference to an outstanding lawsuit Angelina and Chris had at the time the MSA was signed. &nbsp;</p><p>"The parties acknowledge that there is a pending lawsuit against the previous homeowners, which Christopher and Angeline are proceeding with approximately $11,000 in losses and damages."&nbsp;</p><p>Also, Angelina's award from the Fire Department of New York is referenced in the MSA as well.&nbsp;</p><p>"The parties agree that the proceeds from Angeline is FDNY harassment lawsuit should not be subject to equitable distribution and will remain her sole asset free and clear of any claim or interest from Christopher now and forever."&nbsp;</p><h2>INFIDELITY ALLEGATIONS ON CHRIS&nbsp;</h2><p>As The Sun previously exclusively reported, Angelina and Chris' marriage had been rocked by a number of cheating scandals before Chris&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">filed for divorce in January</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Chris was accused of <a href=#>cheating with a beautiful transgendered model</a>.</p><p>In an interview with The Sun, model and activist Jazyln Rose, 23, previously claimed that she and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Angelina</a>'s ex, 42, first began speaking in July 2021- and shared a steamy night together in Miami ealier this year. &nbsp;</p><p>After their tryst, Jazlyn said Chris suddenly became aggressive in conversations with her, even allegedly threatening her. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"He called me and said, 'Well, what if you disappear?'&nbsp;</p><p>"I said to him, 'Well if I disappear, people will find out.'"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Jazlyn said that she is coming forward with her story to make sure people know what happened between them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>She has since blocked Chris' number but said she believes he called her from a private number and said "scary sh*t" to her in recent weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>INFIDELITY ALLEGATIONS ON ANGELINA&nbsp;</h2><p>Angelina was accused of&nbsp;<a href=#>cheating on Chris with a man named Joe Tarallo</a>&nbsp;from Old Bridge, New Jersey,&nbsp;<a href=#>as well as with Mexican reality star Luis Caballero</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Angelina flew to Spain before Christmas to film a new Jersey Shore spinoff show- Paramount Plus' All Star Shore - and promptly met Luis during the wild taping, sources claimed to The Sun at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After the star returned home to New Jersey, Chris allegedly found out that Angelina had cheated on him with co-star Luis - and immediately moved out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As The Sun first reported, Angelina had previously had a&nbsp;<a href=#>steamy affair with New Jersey native Joe</a>, 33, which Chris allegedly already knew about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But the new cheating claims pushed Chris over the edge, the source insisted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"He had known about Joe from Old Bridge, but thought she was now loyal and dedicated to working on their marriage,” a source close to the MTV star said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On The Sun">Read More On The Sun</h2><p>When Chris found out about Luis, "he was heartbroken."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Sun was the first to exclusively report that&nbsp;<a href=#>Chris had filed for divorce&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href=#>moved out of Angelina's home</a>&nbsp;and back to Staten Island earlier this year.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000658690493.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000747142899.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2htZ219cX2RaKGeqqOaxm6%2Fx6ipnmWRo7SmuMinmGaomauus7rInKJmm5intrR5y5qpmqaXmrazrYydoK%2BnopiybrLIp5iloaqasW65zqecsmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
