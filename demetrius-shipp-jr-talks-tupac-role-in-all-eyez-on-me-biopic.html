"Man, this is my first time on a talk show! This is great!" he says with a huge smile. The humble,&nbsp;28-year old was an unlikely pick for the new movie, and had no intention of ever becoming an actor. "I was just working... trying to make a living. I always wanted to be a music producer, so, you know, working on that and then just doing my regular job, paying the bills."
