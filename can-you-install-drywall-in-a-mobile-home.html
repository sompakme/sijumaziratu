 Despite the fact that mobile homes are supposed to be lightweight, the walls still include wooden studs, and producers will often use quarter-inch plywood to cover the frame. The wall studs are positioned to accommodate 4-by-8 panels, so installing the mobile home drywall, which is available in sheets of 8ft by 4ft, should be straightforward.
