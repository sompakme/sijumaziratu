Moneybagg&nbsp;Yo recently posted&nbsp;<a href=# rel>a photo of Ari with an explicit caption</a> on Instagram. Ari just caught flack for <a href=# rel>bringing her son to the club</a>, a decision which she has since defended. The two have also been known to share <a href=# rel>pretty risqué videos</a>.</p><p>Now, Fletcher has added something more to her&nbsp;repertoire for raising eyebrows. In a recent IG story, the influencer showed off her newest chain, which is none other than Jigsaw, the villain from the horror series&nbsp;Saw. The purchase is most likely in reference to Fletcher's haters calling her Jigsaw a while back when she showed off this glam look.</p><p>In the video of the new jewelry, Ari films a closeup of the piece while audio from&nbsp;Saw plays. "I want to play a game," the famous clip says. "There's only one key to open the device. It's in the stomach of your dead cell mate." She added a caption which reads, "Thanks @jewelryunlimited" with a crying laughing emoji.</p><p>Ari was recently gifted some other jewelry by Moneybagg Yo, <a href=# rel>a 22-carat diamond ring</a>, which she claimed she's "scared to wear." All this bling didn't stop rumors from swirling that Ari had been evicted from her home, which she then <a href=# rel>took to the internet to deny</a>. There's also been <a href=# rel>rumors about her and Moneybagg Yo having a child on the way</a>, after Moneybagg Yo posted a tweet which used a bunch of different baby emojis. But Moneybagg seemed to contradict this tweet <a href=# rel>in a new song</a>, which contained the lyrics, "Ari [wants] another baby, but I'm too busy chasing paper. Maybe not right now. Perfect timing might come later."</p><p>Check out Ari's new bling below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkZ4N3gpdmmKuhXZu5psDCoZyrZaOdvLi%2FjKidn2WanrS0rdZmmqGZmaN6r7HWrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
