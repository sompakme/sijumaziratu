Ever since 2020, the sneaker has seen a huge resurgence. Although it never "died," it wasn't exactly on trend during the whole dad shoe crazy. However, it is back and better than ever. This has subsequently led to a whole lot of colorways that fans are always eager to cop. Some might say the shoe is overstaying its welcome, however, others are happy to see it thriving, once again.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Throughout 2023, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">we have seen this shoe truly do numbers</a>. A lot of this has to do with the fact that Jumpman is constantly bringing out new colorways. Almost every single day, we are bringing you the latest news on what is making its way to the market. New offerings are perpetually being unveiled, and this is great news for consumers. Simply put, they have more choices than they know what to do with. Now, we have a new <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Nike</a> Dunk Low to show off, this time called "UNC" for short.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-unc-nike-dunk-low>"UNC" Nike Dunk Low</h2></span><p>Image via Nike</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Upon looking at this sneaker, you can immediately understand why the whole "UNC" nickname is being given here. Firstly, this Nike Dunk Low begins with a white leather base. Secondly, the shoe gets some nice navy blue overlays. This is then followed up by University Blue on the Nike swoosh. When you combine these colors, you get something that could definitely have been worn by <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Michael Jordan</a> in the 80s. If you love this color combination, then these will certainly be a must-cop.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For now, a release date for these is unknown. However, you will be able to cop them for a price of $110 USD. Hopefully, we get to see even more great Nike Dunk Low offerings, very soon.
