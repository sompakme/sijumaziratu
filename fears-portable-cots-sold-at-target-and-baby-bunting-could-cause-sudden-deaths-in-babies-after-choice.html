Choice experts reviewed 26 portable cots for sale and found 18 of them failed its testing, mainly due to soft or poorly fitting mattresses.
These factors are known to heighten the risk of sudden infant deaths.
Choice testing expert Kim Gilmour said a cot’s brand or price was not always an indication of its safety or quality, with leading department stores like Kmart and Target failing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While it’s pleasing to see more manufacturers meeting them, it’s still not mandatory to do so,” Ms Gilmour said.</p><p>“These safety failures are part of a broader problem around product safety protections. Governments often wait until tragedy strikes before they make safety standards mandatory. This reactive approach puts consumers at risk and is deeply inappropriate for products like portable cots.”</p><p>A Kmart Group spokesperson said they disagreed and disputed Choice’s findings in regards to Target and Kmart cots.<br></p><p>“We disagree with Choice claims concerning mattress firmness on the Kmart and Target portacot’s particularly, as both brands have tested this product to these same standards in an independent accredited laboratory and the results showed full compliance,” they said.</p><p>“We disputed Choice’s findings over a month ago and questioned testing methods because Choice do not use an accredited laboratory to test portacots and did not hear a fulsome response – our Kmart and Target Portacot’s have been tested by an independent accredited laboratory and fully complied to the same mandatory and voluntary standards that Choice is referencing.”</p><p>A Nanny Annie spokesperson said their Star Kidz cots also complied with Australian safety standards.</p><p>“We disagree with the findings by Choice. Our Star Kidz Vivo super light travel cots are produced in compliance with both mandatory and voluntary Australian safety standards,” they said.</p><p>“We have the product tested independently by Intertek and passed all the components of the same tests conducted by Choice.”</p><p>Baby Bunting also said their products had been tested by an accredited lab and was confident they complied with requirements.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme8%2BaqZ6mpJ67qHvBmpminaNkwLaww56lZpyVlsGpedaaqaehnpx6sMLEq2SbmZKuerG%2Bzp2snKxfo7K4v4ysq6iqqWR9dXyVmpqdm2hqf3KFkp6ZbXCTbq%2BlgMNsmGudaZaAeA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
