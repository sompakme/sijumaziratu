Genasis was firmly resistant to meeting and building a relationship with his birth mother, especially because he'd watched her enjoy her life on reality TV. Dessalines was more open, and soon, Sky and Des were as thick as thieves.<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> She&nbsp;went to his football games and even attended </a>his high school graduation. After that, Des moved in with his mom and all seemed to be well between the two.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, Sky later accused Des of stealing from her. She said there were items and money missing from her home, but Des denied he'd taken anything.<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> Sky said some cruel things to her son</a>‚Äîshe told him she should have "swallowed" him and that she didn't want him‚Äîin the heat of the moment, but that wasn't the end of their animosity. In a clip from the new season, Des cries t<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">o Sky's best friend and Black Ink owner Ceaser Emanuel</a> as he relives the most recent argument with his mother. He can't get over how she "wished death" on him.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Some believe Sky answered her son on Instagram with a selfie. In the caption, she wrote, "When You Crossed Me You Lost Me ‚úåüèΩ."
