Alan Jones probably comes closest.”</p><p>He also spoke about owning mistakes and apologising, like the time he called Jacinda Ardern “that woman”.</p><p>“I went on-air the next night, at my request, and <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=9d8976c17b3ddd8654fa4f67bbbbf278 data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>apologised</a> because it was a dumb thing to say,” he said.</p><p>“That’s the problem with half the politicians.

When Scott Morrison makes mistakes, he should just own it and say sorry.”</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Price defended <i>The Project</i> against being “too woke” and said he and co-host Waleed Aly had a good relationship despite having completely different politics.</p><p>“There is a wokeness to it, but we like to bust that wokeness open on Monday nights when I’m there. The people on the show aren’t really woke. There are issues that are covered that are a bit woke that I think are ridiculous.</p><p>“But I just say as much, and they’re happy for me to do that. I’ve been there for 12 years now; that’s a miracle.
