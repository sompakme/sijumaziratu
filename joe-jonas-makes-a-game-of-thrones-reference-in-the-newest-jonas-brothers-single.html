Even though this song doesn't have the DIRECT references to their wives and girlfriends that &#34;Sucker&#34; did, there's still a cute little reference Joe Jonas makes to his fiancee Sophie Turner in one of the verses.
Joe sings, &#34;Must've done something right 'cause all these / Lights are green, man, they look like palm trees / And every time that song comes on it's about me / Oh, I feel like Post Malone when I get home / Sittin' there, winning like it's Game of Thrones / And now that we've made it, how complicated was last year?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"Joe was on set during the final season of&nbsp;GoT&nbsp;so much that he ended up signing a non-disclosure agreement to learn the ending," according to&nbsp;ET. Ugh, so lucky.</p><p>The single's a bit more laidback than the very catchy "Sucker" (it might be on my workout playlist, #sorrynotsorry), but still very JoBros in look and feel. The brothers had the same director for both music videos, Anthony Mandler. After "Sucker," Mandler told&nbsp;ET, "Great people and all the wives were amazing."</p><p>As I always ask every time anyone related to&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;says or does anything,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a27040248/emilia-clarke-hair-game-of-thrones-premiere-look/>is it a clue about what happens in the final season</a>?? Probably not. At this point I just need to wait patiently for the show to come out (April 14, get ready people), but the anticipation is killing me.&nbsp;</p><p>For more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the&nbsp;Marie Claire&nbsp;newsletter.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://link.marieclaire.com/join/3oa/mar-newsletter?authId=F0CC0C27-80DA-4734-ABDF-E4115B84A56B&maj=WNL&min=ARTICLES" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>SUBSCRIBE HERE</a></p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
