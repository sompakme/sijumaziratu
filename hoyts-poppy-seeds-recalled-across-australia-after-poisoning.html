Severe poisoning soon after ingestion has occurred in some people who have consumed large amounts of poppy seeds,” the organisation said.</p><p>NSW Health is advising residents to check the poppy seeds in their kitchens amid the recall.</p><p>“NSW Health advises the recalled products are not safe to consume and people who have purchased these recalled batches of poppy seeds should throw them out or return them to the place of purchase for a full refund,” a spokesperson said.</p><p>The products should not be consumed “in any amount” according to NSW health due to “the presence of unusually high levels” of thebaine.</p><p>“Reports of unusual and severe symptoms following poppy seed consumption have now seen at least 12 people requiring medical attention in NSW after developing poisoning soon after ingestion, with additional cases nationally,” a spokesperson said.</p><p>Symptoms of poisoning can be severe and include muscle cramping, muscle spasms and abnormal movements, seizures and even cardiac arrest.</p><p>Medical Director of the NSW Poisons Information Centre, A/Prof Darren Roberts, said the product was not considered safe to eat or to drink, as the chemical detected in the poppy seed product can be dangerous.</p><p>“We are urging anyone who experiences any unusual and severe symptoms to seek immediate medical attention by visiting their nearest Emergency Department. Call triple-0 for emergency assistance,” he said.</p><p>Victorian authorities have confirmed that one person suffered a cardiac arrest and two others are in ICU after consuming poppy seeds.</p><p>South Australian authorities are also warning residents to check the poppy seeds in their kitchens following the recall.</p><p>“At least one South Australian is known to have fallen ill after consuming the affected poppy seed product. It has been reported that a number of people have presented nationally to interstate Emergency Departments (ED) with severe poisoning,” a SA Health spokesperson said.</p><p>“Consumers will not be able to tell which poppy seeds have high thebaine content by looking at the seeds and are advised not to eat them,” Health Protection and Licensing Services executive director Dr Chris Lease said.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Coles data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Coles</a><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Woolworths data-tgev-order=2 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Woolworths</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme8Wopp1nlqS8pXnWmqmnoZ6cwHDB0aCcp6xdp7KkrculZKieXaW8sbzYZqqenZSoeq21zaScnWWkpHqxu8ispqehnpx8r7HWrGSsrJ%2BnxnCBlmpwcJyUa315sJOdam%2BeZmywc4LEb51vaGJtgaOExA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
