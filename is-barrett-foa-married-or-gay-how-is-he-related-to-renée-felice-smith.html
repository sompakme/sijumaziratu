Barrett’s parents, Linda and Conrad Foa, noticed his inclinations towards the theater from an early age and helped hone his skills.&nbsp;His academic records show that he attended Dalton School and later Interlochen Arts Camp.&nbsp;He is a Fine Arts graduate in Musical Theater from the University of Michigan.&nbsp;To further improve his acting skills, Foa attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London for a semester.&nbsp;He also put time into learning acting and plays in various popular theatres, operas and theaters.</span></p><p><span>Before he was known as the nerdy Eric on&nbsp;</span><span>NCIS: LA</span><span>&nbsp;, Barrett Foa was spontaneously involved in theater.&nbsp;His official services to the art of acting go back to 2001.&nbsp;The actor, who began his career on Broadway, has an impressive list of hit productions and Shakespearean plays.&nbsp;Notable features include the 2001 Broadway production of&nbsp;</span><i><span>Mamma Mia!&nbsp;</span></i><span>where he sang and danced, starring Rod in the three-time Tony-nominated Broadway musical&nbsp;</span><span>Avenue Q</span><span>&nbsp;and the 2013 off-Broadway comedy&nbsp;</span><span>Shoppers & Cellars</span><span>&nbsp;, among others.</span></p><p><span>Besides being the tech geek character, Eric Beale starred in Police&nbsp;</span><span>Proceedings NCIS: Los Angeles</span><span>&nbsp;(from 2009 to 2014), Foa has other acting credits such as&nbsp;</span><span>Six Degrees (2007), Numb3rs (2009), Entourage (2009, 2010), The Closer (2009 ), Submissions Only (2011) and My Synthesized Life (2013).</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Barrett Foa married or gay?</span></strong></h2><p><span>The NCIS: Los Angeles</span><span>&nbsp;star Barrett Foa is known for being very private about details of his personal life.&nbsp;Like some of his peers, Foa is not among the celebrities who are considered gay simply because they are neither romantically involved with the opposite sex nor have a dating history.</span></p><span>The blonde actor is openly gay, but his romantic status has been a mystery to the public ever since he burst into the spotlight.&nbsp;The talented thespian apparently feels more comfortable keeping his love life a secret.&nbsp;Additionally, there has been speculation that Foa is secretly and happily married to the love of his life, but such reports remain unconfirmed.</span><p><span>The closest clue the public has ever had regarding Foa’s love life, he posted a teaser on one of his social media platforms in 2016.&nbsp;In the Twitter post, Foa shared a photo of himself standing next to a King Triton mannequin, which he dubbed his “new friend.”&nbsp;That being said, Foa’s relationship status has remained a mystery to many.&nbsp;Still, it’s safe to say that the actor suspected to be single may be married or even secretly.</span></p><h2><strong><span>How is his relationship with Renée Felice Smith?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Although Barret Foa’s sexual preferences are no secret, he was reportedly dating Renée Felice Smith in 2013.&nbsp;But fans of&nbsp;</span><span>NCIS: LA</span><span>&nbsp;will better understand the root of the rumors given the on-screen chemistry between Eric Beale (Barrett Foa) and Nell Jones (Renée Felice Smith) on the series.&nbsp;While the duo may have flirted, swapped, and even kissed on-screen, they certainly have different personalities and tastes.</span></p><p><span>Another reason Foa and Renée Felice Smith may have been rumored to be perhaps because the latter is also fairly tight-lipped about their love life.&nbsp;But Renée’s longtime relationship with her filmmaker boyfriend Christopher Gabriel should be a clue to the obvious.</span></p><p><span>Besides the fact that Renée and Gabriel have been long-term lovers since elementary school, as well as the pictures they often post on Instagram, they don’t know much about the duo’s relationship.&nbsp;Despite the mystery that surrounds both Foa and Smith’s love lives, the actors’ alleged chemistry seems to only exist on screen as both have different love attractions in real life.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiho2Kvor7RnqutZZakrm65wKupop2UYryzecaasGagn6x6qr%2BMoZxmqpWhrrWxw2arqGWimrumsYyfnKWhk5p6tLnIrZ9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
