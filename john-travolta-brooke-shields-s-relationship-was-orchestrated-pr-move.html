We don’t know what the future holds for the 70-year-old actor, but his dating history is drawing attention.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Back in his single era, Travolta was at the height of his fame with movies like Grease and Saturday Night Fever catapulting him to the top of Hollywood’s A-list actors. That’s why one stage mom thought it would be a great idea for her daughter to date him — a tale-as-old-as-time PR dating situation. Teri Shields, the mother of <a href=# id=auto-tag_brooke-shields_1 data-tag=brooke-shields>Brooke Shields</a>, decided to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/slideshow/2482443/celebrities-you-forgot-dated/>orchestrate some publicity</a> for her young supermodel daughter, who was only 16 at the time. Travolta, then 27, agreed to a few dates despite the 11-year age gap. Brooke discussed her mother’s thought process in her 2014 memoir, <a data-pmc-sp-product=ca0dd23ff0f97e5ca4bad60ac8725ef0 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"There Was a Little Girl: The Real Story of My Mother and Me.&nbsp;","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"There Was a Little Girl: The Real Story of My Mother and Me","price":"16.39","id":"0525954848","category":"Actors & Entertainers"},"id":3032747,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>There Was a Little Girl: The Real Story of My Mother and Me.&nbsp;</a> <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kelly-clarkson_5192b1.jpg alt="Kelly Clarkson attends the SiriusXM Next Generation: Industry & Press Preview at The Tisch Skylights at The Shed on November 08, 2023 in New York City." height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Kelly Clarkson Reportedly Put the Feelers Out for a Date With This A-list Actor</span></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kelly-clarkson_5192b1.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Basically my ‘relationships’ had always been orchestrated by my mother in one way or another,” Brooke wrote in her book. “<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/slideshow/2746245/brooke-shields-pretty-baby-documentary-details/>She directed my romantic life</a> sometimes subtly and sometimes not. She didn’t focus on romance (never mind love), but instead wanted to associate me with names that connoted fame, money, and power. These were relationships she supported, also because they were less attainable.” Teri, according to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-brooke-john-just-buddies-vol-16-no-6/ rel=nofollow>People</a>, “played matchmaker” in 1981 so they could both promote their movies. She had Endless Love premiering and he had Blow Out.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Brooke swore nothing happened between them, but the pairing caught the eye of the press. The interview in People was rather cynical, pointing out that they shared the same public relations firm. The magazine described their romance as something “publicists have stirred into the gooeyest romantic wallow of the summer.” It sounds like everyone saw right through this completely fake relationship.&nbsp;They did develop <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/slideshow/9150/celebrity-exes-still-friends/>a sweet friendship</a> even though no one was buying their romance. Travolta gushed, “There are lots of women with physical beauty, but Brooke exudes goodness. She’s untainted. You don’t want anyone to hurt her or say the wrong things, because she’s special.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">At the end of the day, Teri was pleased with her matchmaking prowess because it kept her daughter in the spotlight. “She loved that I had briefly dated John Travolta, Jimmy McNichol, Leif Garrett, Scott Baio, and John Kennedy,” Brooke summed up. “They were all on Teen Beat magazines and stars in their own right. She trusted I’d keep my vow of chastity and like the attention paid to me in these couplings.” Teri was the ultimate momager ahead of her time. She walked, so Kris Jenner could run.</p><p><strong>Before you go, click <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a> to see surprising celebrity couples we never saw coming.</strong> <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kelly-clarkson_5192b1.jpg alt="Kelly Clarkson attends the SiriusXM Next Generation: Industry & Press Preview at The Tisch Skylights at The Shed on November 08, 2023 in New York City." height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Kelly Clarkson Reportedly Put the Feelers Out for a Date With This A-list Actor</span></a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/surprising-celebrity-couples-graphic.jpg alt="Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly" width=693 height=390 sizes="(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpoa2Bof3iAlmihqKCeYsGzrdWoo62ZXZe%2FsLvKnmSsoJmauaW%2FjKipnKCVqMGzrdOem2aoomK%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
