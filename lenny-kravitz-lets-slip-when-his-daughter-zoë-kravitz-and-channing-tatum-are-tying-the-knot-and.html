(The two met while working on Zoë’s directorial debut, Blink Twice, back in 2021.) “He’s a really great guy,” Kravitz said of Tatum. “He was raised well. So, you know, he’s got manners. He’s charming. He’s a soulful human being. And so he’s become part of the family quite quickly.”</p><p>Of Tatum’s connection with his daughter, “He fits and they’re in love,” Kravitz said, adding “We’re going to have a wedding next year.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hCEzkfatt3J4s9HnyoWtBd-1920-80.jpg><p>Kravitz has been vocal about his support of the couple’s relationship, as well as his excitement for their big day, Entertainment Tonight reports. While speaking with the outlet at the 2024 Palm Springs International Film Festival this past January, Kravitz said he was over the moon about their engagement, announced three months prior: “Hey man, that’s life,” Kravitz said. “When your family is happy, when your child is happy, that’s it—I’ve done well. Blessed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GLqnpwPDTmwA8P4yhafTt-1920-80.jpg><p>After meeting on the set of Blink Twice, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lenny-kravitz-reveals-zoe-kravitz-and-channing-tatums-wedding-plans/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Us Weekly</u></a> reported that “things turned romantic fast” after “working together so closely”: “They both thought the other was cool, fun, and attractive, but never acted on it because they were never single,” a source told the outlet at the time. “They both have a lot in common. They’re both very active and love outdoor sports and being outdoors.”</p><p>Since becoming a couple, the pair have remained largely private, but a source told Entertainment Tonight that “Channing and Zoë are doing fantastic and could not be more in love,” they said. “They’re so thrilled about their engagement and to be taking this next step together.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DESaCvHDspRPf4yLLyhPff-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nVBz6ynsaxY3LUqhazhxHe-1920-80.jpg><p>As for that next step of marriage, will Kravitz perform at his daughter’s wedding next year? The rockstar said he “didn’t think so,” and added he would instead “just be hanging out.” He will be giving a father-of-the-bride speech, though, but don’t expect him to plan ahead: “It just comes at the moment,” Kravitz told Entertainment Tonight in January, noting that his speech will come “from the heart.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
