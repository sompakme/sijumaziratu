With the help of her pro partner, Valentin Chmerkovskiy, she hit the ground running — or, rather, foxtrotting — and earned the best score of the competition's first night. "I don't feel we have a lot of competition," Rumer told <a href=#>ABC News</a> after their dominant performance.</p><p dir=ltr>In front of the "DWTS" cameras, Demi Moore admitted that she initially wanted to talk Rumer out of joining the reality show's revolving cast. "My whole insides, I have to be honest, were screaming, 'No,'" she said, per People. However, she quickly became one of Rumer's biggest cheerleaders. Moore joined ex-husband Bruce Willis in the audience for the premiere, where the proud parents watched Rumer face off against competitors including Olympic gymnast Nastia Liukin, "Shark Tank" star Robert Herjavec, and legendary singer Patti LaBelle. Moore even dusted off the ol' <a href=#>Twitter</a> account to ask her followers to vote for her talented daughter.</p><p dir=ltr>Rumer went on to win the mirror ball trophy, but it wasn't the only prize she took home. She told <a href=#>Glamour</a> that her participation allowed her to show people who she really is, and in an interview with <a href=#>Page Six</a>, she revealed that she learned a valuable life lesson: "The only way to find true happiness is to find self-confidence and value from within."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlmaIJ5gY6rrKadomLEqrjLoqpmr5iWwW65zqyrZqiVpL2tsYydpqesXaC7sMOMmpmoraRir7PBwp5kmqaUYrGmucisZJ%2BZnaTCtHnDmqygoKSav3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
