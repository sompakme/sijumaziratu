I’ve never been in this to just be happy to be here. To me, legit, I’m sitting here in my office right now looking at my past accomplishments.</p><p>I’m looking at past championships that are framed on my wall and my eyes are on the top prizes.</p><p>My eyes somewhere down the road are looking at the Intercontinental Championship, the United States Championship, and beyond even that, I’m looking at the Universal Championship, the WWE Championship and things like that.</p><p>Now, how and when we get there, we will see. But that’s my future focus almost singularly and laser-like.”</p><p>In other parts of the interview, Knight talked about Bray Wyatt and he made it clear that working with the former Universal Champion is a unique challenge. In the upcoming weeks, we’ll have to wait and watch how LA Knight and Bray Wyatt’s conflict develops.
