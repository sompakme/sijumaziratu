A source told the : "The Queen will be devastated to have lost her best friend. She grew up with Mrs Rhodes and they had so much shared history. They remained close throughout the Queen's reign and Her Majesty continued to be a regular visitor at Mrs Rhodes's Windsor home until very recently. It is such a sad loss for Her Majesty, Mrs Rhodes' family and everyone in the royal household. She was an extraordinary woman."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3070dac73b57-queen-e-1-z.jpg><p class=text-center id=ee68gFQJoTZa data-wc=5><strong>The pair were close friends</strong></p><p id=ebQ5YR4I2W9C data-wc=139>Mrs Rhodes was a friend of the Queen from a young age, and gave an insight into her early life. Speaking to host Christiane Amanpour on , she said: "The King and Queen in those days made an enormous effort to keep [the Queen and Princess Margaret's] childhood sort of sacrosanct. I mean, it was just a time for learning and enjoying. And I think that they have succeeded awfully well." She also confirmed that the Queen had no plans to retire at the age of 80, telling the : "I'm perfectly certain she will never retire as such. It's not like a normal job and, to the Queen, the vows that she made on Coronation Day are something so deep and so special that she wouldn't consider not continuing to fulfil those vows until she dies."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
