There, he meets her folks for the first time and hopes to gain their approval before proposing to their daughter.</p><p>To present her film at Arclight’s Cinedome, writer and first-time director <strong>Tina Gordon Chism</strong> took the stage and expressed her appreciation for the cast. “They are everything to me. As a first-time director — for them to trust me meant everything,” she said. “They did all the heavy lifting in the movie.”</p><p>As a fellow first timer on the film, Peeples marks Robinson’s leading man debut. The Office&nbsp;actor told reporters on the red carpet: “It was a dream to be in my first leading man role. I grew as an actor. We had each other’s back. Kerry is this ultimate woman — she’s smart, beautiful, talented, brilliant. <strong>David Alan&nbsp;Grier</strong>&nbsp;is the funniest dude on the planet. […] It was&nbsp;amazing.”</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>VIDEO:&nbsp;Kerry Washington on Her Stylist: ‘We Were Fashion Twins Separated at Birth’</a></strong></p><p>With the film focused on family quirks, Washington told reporters how she appreciated the message about being with supportive loved ones.</p><p>“I love that you come see this film and leave feeling really good about family, life, love, and it’s because this family really loves each other,” said the&nbsp;Scandal&nbsp;actress. “And I feel that about my family. We’re all very supportive of each other. I don’t think my family has the same intense secrets that this family has because they’ve got a lot going on, but still, I think we all identify with family, loving each other through it all.”</p><p>Chism, who wrote the script, had a clear vision of telling the film’s story and putting together the perfect cast for it.</p><p>“She’s the only person who could direct it because she knew how everything looked — the sound and smell,” film producer <strong>Stephanie Allain</strong> told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, raving of Chism. “She was a first timer, but it didn’t feel that way because she was so confident. The script really attracted all the talent.”</p><p>On set, Allain described Robinson and Washington’s chemistry as being “kind of like a real couple.” She added: “They’re very funny together. I think they inspire each other.”</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>STORY:&nbsp;Peeples: Film Review</a></strong></p><p><strong>Tyler James Williams</strong>, who plays Grace’s young brother Simon, also agreed that the pair’s dynamic made their relationship persuasive.</p><p>“I believed them as a couple, I actually believed it,” Williams told THR. “Everyone was having such a good time. Everyone was so comfortable around each other. You don’t find that in films where a lot of people are that comfortable.”</p><p>The feeling was mutual among other cast members.</p><p>Playing Wade’s older brother Chris, <strong>Malcolm Barrett</strong> described how he knew they became a family while filming. “One of the craziest moments that let us know we were a family is I think [the] two or three days of filming in the house, they locked down the piano in the main room during non-takes because we were using it too much and doing too many songs,” said Barrett. “So afterwards it was like, alright, we know the dynamic between us.”</p><p>Grier, Grace’s overbearing and humorless father in the movie, recalled his favorite on-set moment, telling&nbsp;THR, “when all the cast was there. We could all interact together. Everyone at the house — playing off each other’s [energy] — for me, that was the most fun.”</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>STORY:&nbsp;Craig Robinson, Greg Daniels Comedy Gets Pilot Order at NBC</a></strong></p><p>Similar to her cast members’ sentiments about enjoying each other’s company, Washington shared with THR&nbsp;that “the dinner table in the movie was my favorite [scene] because a lot of us worked together all day.”</p><p>Tyler Perry Presents Peeples&nbsp;hits theaters on May 10.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLGxxKmjnqtdqMGivtJmop6qoq56uK3SoaCnn6Sku26v0ZqgoGVlZ31ygZRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
