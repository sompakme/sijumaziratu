Grinning from ear to ear as she wore Elizabeth's brightly coloured necklace and a striking yellow ring, Drew looked every inch the glamour puss as she took heed of the once in a lifetime opportunity. Wearing a simple cream blouse and wide-leg black trousers, the new mother wore a pink statement lipstick to let the jewellery shine. Also wearing a flagship piece from Elizabeth's collection, star Naomi Watts attended the event in a muted ensemble. Opting for an all-black ensemble to set off the star's sophisticated rose tassel necklace, Naomi paid homage to the sophisticated style of the gem's former owner. It was Julianne Moore, however, who arguably held the honour of the night. Wearing the striking emerald necklace that Richard Burton bestowed his wife as a wedding gift in 1964,&nbsp;actress Julianne was the first person to wear the $6.1 million necklace since Elizabeth. Wearing a contrasting red dress to set the piece alight, the star's elegant poise was a perfect partnership for the Bulgari piece. <strong>Marisa Tomei</strong>, <strong>Kirsten Dunst</strong> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Louise Roe</a> were also in attendance at the decadent celebration.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/99cfc2248be4-louise-roe-z.jpg><p id=eo2Hb89jDLxT data-wc=143>Shying away from the spotlight in recent years, Spiderman star Kirsten entered the Beverly Hills event in a show-stopping style. Wearing a black chiffon tiered gown, the 30-year-old completed the look with an embellished beaded clutch. Although she enjoyed the glitz of the jeweller's showcase, Louise Roe let one piece of jewllery do the talking- her engagement ring. Chatting exclusively to <strong>HELLO!</strong>, the fashion journalist spoke about her prize jewel that her and fiancé Josh Slack chose together. The exquisite yellow-gold diamond ring from Boodles shone on the star’s finger as she graced the red carpet. Elizabeth's jewellery sale reached record sales figures for auction house Christie’s when it was sold last year. The actress' first Bulgari piece, an emerald and diamond brooch, soared to new heights as it was sold for $6,578,500, making a record price of $280,000 for emeralds per carat.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
