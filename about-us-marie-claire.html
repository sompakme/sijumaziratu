Before joining Marie Claire, Brittany held various design lead roles at Vox Media, first at Racked, then the Vox Storytelling Team, a group tasked with experimental storytelling, and then as the Design Director of Eater, a food and restaurant network. In this role, she established a brand voice for the storied food brand by creating custom illustrations, expanding its network of freelancers, and art directing its editorial packages, including travel guides, a custom volunteer search engine, and award tentpoles. Eater’s visuals became well-recognized and complemented the brand’s rigorous reporting as it moved into policy, immigration, foodways, and the significant cultural impact of food. In her collaboration with Eater NY, one of the illustrations she commissioned, “Can Paying $50K for PR Still Make a Restaurant Famous?” was selected for American Illustration 39. During her seven-year tenure with Vox, she wore many hats, including helping to guide editorial strategy, creating end-to-end experiences, and contributing to the company’s broader design and product goals. In addition, she had the honor of being on the Vox Visual Ethics Committee, a cross-department group tasked with creating a guide to helping all staff make informed and inclusive choices around imagery. Brittany has a Bachelor’s in Illustration from the Maryland Institute College of Art. She also served as a proud judge for the National Magazine Awards in 2021 and Food Photography Awards for PDN Taste in 2019. Brittany currently lives in Brooklyn, NY.

It was first published as a weekly in October 1937, where it sold 500,000 copies of its first issue and, in 1939, nearly one million copies on the eve of World War II. With Marcelle Auclair at its head, Marie Claire became the first modern women’s fashion magazine.</p><p>Marie Claire was born a second time in October 1954, with the same founder, Jean Prouvost; the same editor, Marcelle Auclair; and the same mission: “to open up the future for women, help them make their own way through changing times...inform them about subjects that are rocking their world, give them a voice to share the challenges they face and those of the changing society they live in."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When Jean Prouvost left Marie Claire’s helm in 1976, Evelyne Prouvost, one of his granddaughters, created Groupe Marie Claire. Evelyne became Chairman of the company, grouping the women-led titles of the Prouvost empire. In 1994, the first American edition of Marie Claire hit newsstands. In 2004, Arnaud de Contades became CEO of Groupe Marie Claire.</p><p>Today, Marie Claire is present in 29 markets around the world, including Europe, the Americas, Asia Pacific, South Africa, and the Middle East, making Marie Claire one of the most widely recognized women’s fashion media brands in the world.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-advertising><span>Advertising</span></h2><p>If you’re interested in advertising with Marie Claire, please contact Samantha Halperin at marieclaireadvertising@futurenet.com.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-newsletter><span>Newsletter</span></h2><p>For celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features delivered straight to your inbox, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/newsletter/>subscribe</a> to the Marie Claire newsletter.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-contact-us><span>Contact Us</span></h2><p>For interviews, press requests, or general comments, please <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/about/news/a2709/contact-us/>contact us</a> via <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>pr@futurenet.com</a>.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-follow-us><span>Follow Us</span></h2><p>Follow us on <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.facebook.com/MarieClaire/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Facebook</u></a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/marieclaire referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Twitter</u></a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/marieclairemag/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Instagram</u></a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.youtube.com/c/marieclaire referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>YouTube</u></a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.pinterest.com/marieclaire/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Pinterest</u></a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://open.spotify.com/user/marieclairemagazine referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90373660-marie-claire referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Goodreads</u></a>, and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://flipboard.com/@MarieClaire referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Flipboard</u></a>.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-work-with-us><span>Work With Us</span></h2><p>Join our team of world-class writers, editors, and designers. <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://apply.workable.com/futureplc/?lng=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>View job openings</u></a>.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-we-test-products><span>How We Test Products</span></h2><p>When it comes to the products Marie Claire recommends, we take your faith in us seriously.
