The hearing will open at 10am at Poplar Coroner's Court in London, a representative of the court said. It's likely to be adjourned soon after for several weeks while the coroner gathers the post-mortem report, toxicology tests and other evidence. Caroline's family confirmed the <a class=hm-link href=#>tragic news of her death on Saturday </a>with a statement saying: "We can confirm that our Caroline passed away today on the 15th February. We would ask that the press both respect the privacy of the family at this difficult time." Caroline's lawyer confirmed that she sadly took her own life and was found deceased in her Stoke Newington flat.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=eYVudWMSOQIX data-wc=13><strong>WATCH: Love Island pay tribute to Caroline Flack after her death, aged 40</strong></p><p id=edvG7l6FUxh0 data-wc=48>ITV released a statement on Saturday via Twitter that read: "Everybody at Love Island and ITV is shocked and saddened by this desperately sad news. Caroline was a much loved member of the Love Island team and our sincere thoughts and condolences are with her family and friends."</p><p id=elBw4wxoARmV data-wc=81>Caroline stood down from her Love Island presenting duties after she was charged with assaulting her boyfriend, Lewis Burton, in December. She denied the charge. Her management company said she had been "under huge pressure" since then, and it criticised the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for refusing to drop the charge, even though Lewis said he did not want the case to go ahead. Bail conditions had stopped Caroline having any contact with her boyfriend ahead of her trial next month.</p><p id=eYU2nHQ1-lxP data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!'s editor-in-chief Rosie Nixon: Caroline Flack's passing is a reminder that we should all be kinder to each other</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8bd0eba01d6f-carolineflackoninsta-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=enpp9vat0xHs data-wc=7><strong>Caroline Flack's final Instagram post on Friday</strong></p><p id=exKR7y2SUxCG data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>7 ways you can be kinder to yourself</a></strong></p><p id=eXJ3jWTUk4lg data-wc=88>On Sunday, Lewis wrote an emotional tribute to Caroline on Instagram, promising the star he would "be your voice baby" and that he would "try [to] make you proud everyday".
