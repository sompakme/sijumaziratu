Outlander follows WWII nurse Claire (<span data-scayt_word=Caitriona data-scaytid=2>Caitriona</span> <span data-scayt_word=Balfe data-scaytid=3>Balfe</span>) accidentally travels back in time to the Scottish Highlands in the <span data-scayt_word=1700s data-scaytid=4>1700s</span>. While learning how to survive in this new dangerous climate, she meets and falls in love with Highlander Jamie Fraser (Sam <span data-scayt_word=Heughan data-scaytid=5>Heughan</span>), and the rest is literally history. The two newlyweds attempt to navigate murky political waters to try and prevent the Scottish culture and way of life from extinction while war is brewing and enemies try to pull them apart from every direction.&nbsp;</p><p>While Claire and Jamie have managed to make it out of two seasons of the <span data-scayt_word=Starz data-scaytid=6>Starz</span>&nbsp;drama alive, their friends, loved ones, allies and enemies have not been so lucky. In order to prepare for season three, The Hollywood Reporter looks back on all the most shocking deaths on Outlander so far.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>11. Horrocks (Lochlann O'Mearain)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/out_113-20140707-nd_1134_6x4-h_2016.jpg><p>In "The Watch," Jamie's brother-in-law Ian (Steven Cree) was forced to take a man's life in order to save Jamie's. When the British traitor <span data-scayt_word=Horrocks data-scaytid=1>Horrocks</span> arrived at <span data-scayt_word=Lallybroch data-scaytid=4>Lallybroch</span>, knowing full well the price on Jamie's head, he tried to blackmail Jamie. To everyone's surprise, it was Ian who saves the day by killing <span data-scayt_word=Horrocks data-scaytid=2>Horrocks</span>. But since Ian was not accustomed to such violence, he's the first character on Outlander who really struggles with the consequences of what he's done, even though he knew that <span data-scayt_word=Horrocks data-scaytid=3>Horrocks</span> was a bad man who was threatening his family.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.5><h2>10. Le Comte St. Germain (Stanley Weber)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/outlander-star-chamber-h_2016.jpg><p>After season one's villain, Black Jack Randall (Tobias <span data-scayt_word=Menzies data-scaytid=1>Menzies</span>), traumatized Claire and Jamie in truly disturbing ways, season two's villain, Le <span data-scayt_word=Comte data-scaytid=2>Comte</span> St. <span data-scayt_word=Germain data-scaytid=19>Germain</span>, felt like a disappointing follow-up. Sure, he was still dangerous, as proven by the fact that he poisoned Claire and tried to kill her on multiple occasions while she was in France. But he got his just desserts when the King of France (Lionel <span data-scayt_word=Lingelser data-scaytid=6>Lingelser</span>) forced Claire to use her "sorcery" powers to decide the fates of suspected witchcraft users Master Raymond (Dominique <span data-scayt_word=Pinon data-scaytid=7>Pinon</span>) and St. <span data-scayt_word=Germain data-scaytid=4>Germain</span>. Claire tried to save them both, but Master Raymond poisoned St. <span data-scayt_word=Germain data-scaytid=5>Germain</span> after he confessed to trying to kill Claire. It was clear that Raymond spiked St. <span data-scayt_word="Germain's" data-scaytid=8>Germain's</span> cup with poison, so viewers knew his death was coming, but it was shocking to see it finally play out in such a theatrical way.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>9. Angus (Stephen Walters)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/out_115-20140821-nd_0262_6x4-h_2016.jpg><p>After the victorious Battle of <span data-scayt_word=Prestonpans data-scaytid=1>Prestonpans</span>, crude, goofy, fan-favorite Highlander Angus sat by his friend Rupert's (Grant O'Rourke) bedside as he recovered from his injuries. But since the stubborn Angus didn't get proper medical care for his own internal bleeding, he ended up collapsing and dying, with Claire unable to help him. Another fan-favorite Highlander, Kincaid (<span data-scayt_word=Gregor data-scaytid=2>Gregor</span> Firth), also died from his injuries from the battle. The one-two punch of these deaths made the victory bittersweet for everyone.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>8. Arthur Duncan (John Sessions)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/outlander-arthur-duncan-h_2016.jpg><p>In "By the Pricking of My Thumbs," <span data-scayt_word=Geillis data-scaytid=1>Geillis</span> (<span data-scayt_word=Lotte data-scaytid=4>Lotte</span> <span data-scayt_word=Verbeek data-scaytid=5>Verbeek</span>) poisoned her <span data-scayt_word=18th data-scaytid=6>18th</span> century husband Arthur after <span data-scayt_word="Dougal's" data-scaytid=7>Dougal's</span> (Graham <span data-scayt_word=McTavish data-scaytid=8>McTavish</span>) own wife died so they can be together out in the open. But it did not work: <span data-scayt_word=Colum data-scaytid=9>Colum</span> (Gary Lewis) forbade <span data-scayt_word=Dougal data-scaytid=10>Dougal</span> from pursuing a relationship with <span data-scayt_word=Geillis data-scaytid=2>Geillis</span>, and Claire and <span data-scayt_word=Geillis data-scaytid=3>Geillis</span> were then arrested for witchcraft.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>7. Greg Edgars (James Robinson)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/outlander-greg-edgars-h_2016.jpg><p><span data-scayt_word=Geillis data-scaytid=1>Geillis</span> certainly was predictable. In the season two finale, Claire, Brianna (Sophie Skelton) and Roger (Richard Rankin) witnessed <span data-scayt_word=Geillis data-scaytid=2>Geillis</span>/Gillian <span data-scayt_word=Edgars data-scaytid=4>Edgars</span> (her modern name) going through the stones for her first time. Since she believed you needed a human sacrifice to travel through time, <span data-scayt_word=Geillis data-scaytid=3>Geillis</span> murdered her modern husband Greg to make it happen. While viewers didn't get to know her first husband all too well before he was murdered (besides him drunkenly pining for his missing wife), witnessing the stones' magic firsthand was the final push Brianna and Roger needed to believe Claire's story, so his death holds major weight for the series moving forward.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>6. Alex Randall (Laurence Dobiesz)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/tobias_menzies_as_black_jack_randall_laurence_dobiesz_as_alex_randall-_episode_212-h_2016.jpg><p>Black Jack's younger, kinder brother Alex had the unfortunate luck to contract a fatal illness just as he fell in love with Mary Hawkins (Rosie Day). Before he succumbed to his illness, his dying wish was for his love Mary to marry Black Jack so that their unborn child would grow up with money and protection thanks to Black Jack's military history and legacy. This unholy matrimony solidified Claire's modern husband Frank's (<span data-scayt_word=Menzies data-scaytid=1>Menzies</span>) existence in the future, except it turned out that he actually came from Alex's bloodline and not Black Jack, much to Claire's delight.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>5. Frank Randall</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/out_105-20140324-nd_0267_6x41-h_2016.jpg><p>When the season two finale began, viewers immediately found out that not only have 20 years passed since Claire returned to Frank in modern time, but Frank has also died. We never got to see Frank raising Jamie's daughter Brianna as his own child, or helping Claire ease back into life in modern times. It was quite a shock to the system, but one that viewers had to get over quickly as the super-sized finale continued.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>4. Danton (Andrea Dolente)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/outlander-danton-h_2016.jpg><p>This death was extremely welcome to watch play out onscreen as Mary finally got her revenge on the Duke of <span data-scayt_word="Sandringham's" data-scaytid=1>Sandringham's</span> (Simon Callow) valet <span data-scayt_word=Danton data-scaytid=2>Danton</span> after learning that he was the masked man who had raped her in Paris. The young girl stabbed and killed him while Claire and the Duke could only look on, horrified. Mary took her fate into her own hands after being pushed around all her life, and it was truly a joy to see.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>3. The Duke of Sandringham (Simon Callow)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/out_110-20140217-em_1061_6x4-h_2016.jpg><p>Another shocking death that was more satisfying than heartbreaking came just moments later, when <span data-scayt_word=Murtagh data-scaytid=1>Murtagh</span> (Duncan <span data-scayt_word=Lacroix data-scaytid=2>Lacroix</span>) also was finally able to get his revenge after not being able to protect Mary and Claire from <span data-scayt_word="Danton's" data-scaytid=3>Danton's</span> attack. After learning that the Duke of <span data-scayt_word=Sandringham data-scaytid=4>Sandringham</span> was the one who ordered the attack to happen in the first place, he beheaded the Duke and laid the bloody head at Claire's feet. Talk about a <span data-scayt_word=mic data-scaytid=5>mic</span> drop moment.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>2. Dougal MacKenzie (Graham McTavish)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/outlander_dougalmackenziegrahammctavish-h_2016.jpg><p>After accidentally overhearing Claire and Jamie's plans to assassinate Prince Charles (Andrew <span data-scayt_word=Gower data-scaytid=1>Gower</span>) in an attempt to stop the disastrous Battle of <span data-scayt_word=Culloden data-scaytid=2>Culloden</span> before it happened, <span data-scayt_word=Dougal data-scaytid=3>Dougal</span> tried to kill them for treason. But Claire and Jamie worked together in the resulting fight, and they ended up overpowering the tough Highlander, stabbing and killing <span data-scayt_word=Dougal data-scaytid=4>Dougal</span>. This fan-favorite character always walked the line between good and bad, depending on his mood, but watching the expression on his face as he died was heartbreaking as his beloved nephew was the one who delivered the killing blow.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.5><h2>1. Faith</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/outlander-2x07-faith-3182-h_2016.jpg><p>In one of the most <span data-scayt_word=heartwrenching data-scaytid=5>heartwrenching</span> episodes of the entire series, Claire gave birth to her and Jamie's daughter Faith, but she was stillborn and Claire nearly died from complications from the birth. The rest of the hour is told in flashbacks from Claire's perspective, from when she held her dead baby in her arms, in denial, all alone while Jamie was held in the Bastille for the dueling Black Jack Randall. It took Mother <span data-scayt_word=Hildegarde data-scaytid=1>Hildegarde</span> (Frances de la Tour), Master Raymond and Claire's friend Louise (Claire <span data-scayt_word=Sermonne data-scaytid=2>Sermonne</span>) to help bring her back to reality. When Jamie was finally released from prison, he and Claire mend their broken relationship and the death of their child motivates them to leave Paris and return to Scotland.</p><p>What do you think was the most heartbreaking death on Outlander so far?
