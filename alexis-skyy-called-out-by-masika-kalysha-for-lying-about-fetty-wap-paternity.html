Soon, Masika and the mother of Fetty's other child, Lezhae Zeona, slammed the model for allegedly purposefully lying about paternity.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Find my comment from 2 years ago on the shade room and don't ever fkn question me again. Foh," Masika tweeted on Friday (December 11). The comment Masika was referring to occurred years ago when she and Alexis were&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">engaged in an online spat.</a> Masika wrote: "DON'T SPEAK ON MY CHILD WHEN U HAVE TO USE FACETIME TO SPEAK TO UR CHILD!

"But let's talk about how Alexis been knew my kids father wasn't her baby's father but purposely went along with that BS story just to<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> make my pregnancy emotionally more trying</a> (mind you we were pregnant at the same time)," she said. "While I was carrying this mans real child you traumatized my entire pregnancy experience and Wap went along with it not even caring how it would make me (and ultimately our child, Zy growing inside of me) feel."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Evil people I tell you," Lezhae continued. "But while the devil works the Lord works harder and I'm blessed and highly favored." Alexis hasn't responded to their accusations.
