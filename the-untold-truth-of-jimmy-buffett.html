It took Buffett a while to strike on it, too, as it appears on Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes, the singer's <a href=#>eighth album</a>. Buffett recorded the song with the aid of producer <a href=#>Norbert Putnam</a>, also responsible for putting to vinyl the similarly smooth sounds of acts like Dan Fogelberg and Linda Ronstadt.&nbsp;</p><p>So what's the story behind the song? Well, the singer-songwriter wanted to double down on making what <a href=#>Putnam told Sound on Sound</a> were "records about the ocean." After all, Fogelberg had wanted his 1977 album Nether Lands to have a mountain feel, so Putnam recorded the record in a mountain-set studio. He similarly booked Buffett (and his band, the Coral Reefers) for some time at Criteria Studios in the seaside city of Miami.</p><p>During the sessions, according to Putnam, Buffett arrived one day with news of a song he was working on. "He comes in and starts telling me about a day he had in Key West. He was coming home from a bar, and he lost one of his flip-flops, and he stepped on a beer can top, and he couldn't find the salt for his margarita," Putnam recalled. "He says he's writing lyrics to it, and I say, 'That's a terrible idea for a song.'" A few days later Buffett presented the lyrics — which didn't stray too far from the details he shared with Putnam — to what would become "Margaritaville."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9l25ncW1fqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2ftq652GaZrp6WmsG1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
