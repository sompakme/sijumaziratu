moments, with England only going ahead on extra time.</p><p id=ejXoiQmW_JO data-wc=32>"I've been around football fans for a long time and I know how they behave and I knew the country was going to go into a meltdown for a day at least."</p><p id=eBLoNlm4W2t data-wc=49>Reflecting on his own footballing career, which saw him scoop 21 caps for the national side, Jermaine admitted her felt a lot of "pride". He did, however, concede: "Some disappointment in there as well, I would have loved to have played more, could have been 41/51 caps quite easily.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7843b35344ae-jermaine-jenas-wimbledon-emirates.jpg><p id=e7upO2JsrQGF data-wc=56>"When you retire, and you look back on your career because when you're in it you don't see it, <strong>but for a period of time I was one of the 23 best players in the country</strong>.

However, the couple's hectic schedules made it difficult to spend time together and they parted ways in 2019.&nbsp;</p><h2>Serena Williams and Drake</h2><p id=eocOzp5XXc>Tennis queen Serena and Canadian rapper Drake were rumoured to have had an on-and-off relationship from 2011 to 2015. They first met at a charity tennis tournament in 2011 and began dating shortly after.&nbsp;</p><h2>Naomi Osaka and Cordae</h2><p id=emQULZUOtr>The Japanese tennis player has been romantically linked to rapper Cordae since 2019, and in July 2023, they welcomed a baby girl named Shai. However, it seems the couple have sparked split rumours with the tennis star removing all traces of Cordae from her Instagram page.&nbsp;</p><h2>Caroline Wozniacki and Rory McIlroy</h2><p id=eYt03mWDXr>This sports couple started dating in 2010 and actually got engaged three years later. In 2014, Rory was said to have called things off in a brief three-minute phone call to Caroline after they sent their wedding invites. Caroline has since married American basketball player David Lee.&nbsp;</p><h2>Andy Roddick and Mandy Moore</h2><p id=etPrR-TVBp>The American star dated actress Mandy Moore in the early 2000s before he married wife Brooklyn Decker. They met on the set of the rom-com How to Deal in 2003. One year after the tennis champion took home the U.S. Open championship title, the former couple called it quits in 2004.&nbsp;</p><h2>Andre Agassi and Brooke Shields</h2><p id=eeVA7PoyCT>The Hollywood star was married to former world number one tennis player Andre Agassi from 1997 until 1999, when they split largely because of his addiction to crystal meth. They dated for four years before they wed.</p><p id=eTm1FsberaHH data-wc=33>Jermaine already has some presenting experience under his belt, with The <a class=hm-link href=#>One Show</a>, but it also appears that he's keen to start fronting the BBC's main football show: .</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0cd086154c93-jermaine-jenas-wife-smile.jpg><p id=e-gPukwVzrx0 data-wc=46>Asked whether it was his dream job, the sportsman responded: "I have a lot of dreams and those dreams probably change every six months. I'm just a driven individual, I'm just trying to achieve the best I can possibly be in the field that I'm in.</p><p id=etoTzfenZ9jH data-wc=52>"With that particular job, people saw what I was doing in that field and put one and one together and got two. 'Gary's coming to an end, Jermaine is doing great work, he's got to be in line'. But there's people like Gabby Logan and Alex Scott who would love that job."</p><p id=eeIGAaFpfH31 data-wc=88>With younger players much on the rise, Jermaine also had a key bit of advice for them. He told us: "<strong>You need to have a ball at your feet 24/7, I had a ball at my feet 24/7 and I had all the technique in the world and it still wouldn't have been enough.&nbsp;</strong>Loved football, still wouldn't have been enough. I had an edge and most players I came across had an edge, there was something in all of our lives that we turned into a positive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9ae516229203-jermaine-jenas-wife.jpg><p id=ej2CaI-y5wbv data-wc=35>"Each athlete has something that we use as fuel, so when it's raining, I'm going out to run because I know the person whose place I'm trying to take it sat at home doing nothing."</p><p id=euAwaCVqnT8s data-wc=43>And Jermaine was passionate about his own daughters getting involved, confirming that both his 16-year-old and 11-year-old already play the sport. "My 16-year-old is more going down the athletics route at the moment," he revealed. "She's doing the 100m and she is quick!"</p><p id=ebaOSmOTK7dk data-wc=42>He added: "I want them to do what they want to do. I don't know if they've got 100% to take what it takes to be footballers, their life has been too nice. My two-year-old son, he's too young at the moment."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
