Apparently the title of the letter, ‘To the Hebrews,’ did not belong to the original text. The content of the letter, however, suggests the appropriateness of the title and that the letter was intended for a specific local group of Jewish Christians known personally by the author.</p><p>“Since the letter itself is anonymous, speculation has also arisen over its authorship. The style and language patterns do not seem to be those of Paul; however, many of the ideas and teachings in the epistle are typical of those he set forth in his other letters. Some have therefore concluded that Paul was the author responsible for the teachings and that another was responsible for the literary form of the letter. (See Sidney B. Sperry, “Paul’s Life and Letters,” pages 268-72.) Of great significance to Latter-day Saints is the fact that Joseph Smith regarded Paul as the author of the epistle. (See “Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,” p. 59; <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Doctrine and Covenants 128:15</a>.)</p><p>“[Hebrews was] apparently [written] from Italy (see <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Hebrews 13:24</a>), and likely from Rome. The Codex Alexandrinus, an important early Bible manuscript, reads ‘from Rome’ as the place of origin.</p><p>“Most scholars place the writing of the letter before the time of the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. Assuming Paul to be the author, the letter was likely written in the early 60s during his first imprisonment in Rome.</p><p>“A tendency of many early Jewish converts to Christianity was to regard their new faith as a sect within Judaism, or a sort of reformed Judaism with Christ in the picture. Shortly before his imprisonment in Rome, Paul had spent a good deal of time in Palestine. He likely had made friends of many Jewish Christians and had seen firsthand the tendency among some Jewish members to revert to the old Mosaic order.</p><p>“Therefore, in this letter Paul seems to be warning such Jewish members against apostatizing or reverting to Judaism (see <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Hebrews 3:12</a>; <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Hebrews 10:26, 32-39</a>).</p><p>“The book of Hebrews ties the lesser law of the Mosaic order to the living Christ by emphasizing the superiority of the new gospel covenant, made effectual by the Savior’s sacrifice, over the old law, and by showing how the old law was actually fulfilled in Christ.”</p><p><b>— J. Lewis Taylor, former Church Educational System instructor and administrator, in the April 1976 Ensign article, </b><a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><b>“New Testament Backgrounds: Thessalonians through Hebrews”</b></a></p><p>“The remainder of the New Testament writings — the Book of Hebrews, seven general epistles and Revelation — were mostly written late in the first century to combat troubles within and without the church. Hebrews, 1 Peter and Revelation are Christian answers to conflict with the Roman government. …</p><p>“It was to convince some Jewish Christians living in Rome from taking the easy way out by lapsing back into Judaism that the Book of Hebrews was written. The writer’s thesis was to demonstrate the superiority of Christianity to Judaism, of Christ to the prophets and priests of the Old Testament.”</p><p><b>— C.

Other scriptures affirm this. The New Testament declares, ‘In that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted’ (<a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Hebrews 2:18</a>). … All who suffer any kind of mortal infirmities should remember that our Savior experienced that kind of pain also, and that through His Atonement, He offers each of us the strength to bear it.”</p><p><b>— President </b><a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><b>Dallin H.

He, Himself — or by angels or authorized servants on earth — preaches the gospel, administers ordinances, performs miracles and heals the afflictions of people today. He continues to be mindful of us. He is mindful of us as a people. But most miraculously He is still mindful of us individually. In some marvelous way, and though He is not physically present with each of us, He still feels the tug on the hem of His garment from a humble handmaiden in the midst of a multitude. He still hears the cry of the blind, perceives the longing of the sincere publican, calls common men to be His servants, tells the repentant sinner to go and sin no more. He still pleads our cause universally and individually before the Father. He still calls us by name and invites us to arise and come forth unto Him. He still condescends from His high and holy place to lift us.”</p><p><b>— David L.

Scripture may educate, increase testimony of the Savior Jesus Christ and even generate desires to serve God, but it does not confer authority. Nor does priesthood authority come by inspiration or aspiration. Priesthood authority comes only by ordination. The Bible makes this clear.</p><p>“During His earthly ministry, the Savior Jesus Christ told the Twelve Apostles, ‘Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit’ (<a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>John 15:16</a>). The Apostle Paul taught, ‘No man taketh this honour [the priesthood] unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron’ (<a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Hebrews 5:4</a>). …</p><p>“[Priesthood] authority is obtained only by being chosen and ordained of God.”</p><p><b>— President Dallin H.

Whether it arises from our own sins and mistakes or something else, adversity is a fact of mortal life. Some people think they should be spared from any adversity if they keep God’s commandments, but… Even the Savior was not exempt:</p><p>“‘Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</p><p>“‘And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him’ (<a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Hebrews 5:8-9</a>).</p><p>“For those of us who are accountable, hardship is often a crucial element of our eventually ‘being made perfect.’ It is what makes life more than a simple multiple-choice test. God is not just interested in what we do or don’t do but in what we are becoming. If we are willing, He will teach us to act as He acts rather than simply to be acted upon by other forces (see <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>2 Nephi 2:14-16</a>).”</p><p><b>— Elder </b><a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><b>D.

When you pray, are you really praying or just saying prayers? Are you superficial with your prayers? …</p><p>“At the very moment we say, ‘Father in Heaven,’ He hears our prayers and is sensitive to us and our needs. And so His eyes and His ears are now connected to you. He reads our minds, and He feels our hearts. You cannot hide anything from Him. Now, the wonderful thing is that He will see you with eyes of love and mercy — love and mercy that we cannot fully understand.

I saw that scattered among the congregation were other early-returned missionaries. A desire to help them grew in my heart as I looked around. I knew that sharing my experiences could be a way of ministering to them and helping them continue along the covenant path despite this seeming speed bump along the way.</p><p>“Through this dream, Heavenly Father let me know that He cares. He appreciates the righteous service we gave as missionaries, no matter how long our full-time service lasted. ‘God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which you have shewed toward his name’ (<a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Hebrews 6:10</a>).”</p><p><b>— Liahona Ficquet in the July 2019 Liahona article, </b><a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><b>“He Won’t Forget Your Work”</b></a></p><p>“Do you ever feel like hope uses its feathers to fly as far away from you as possible? As though a loss, trauma or a long unfulfilled wish has snuffed out the song of any hope?</p><p>“Perhaps you have seen a growing cynicism in the world around you. Or perhaps you have seen the melancholy weight of hopelessness in yourself. I believe that at some point, likely at several points in life, we all do. And while the temptation to sink into the sludge of despair can be bitterly appealing, hope is the ‘anchor of the soul’ (<a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Hebrews 6:19</a>), and we need that anchor!</p><p>“But no matter how dismal things may seem, hope can always be found. Hope itself exists because Jesus Christ suffered an infinite Atonement. Hope is as infinite as His Atonement, so it truly ‘never stops — at all’ (Emily Dickinson).”</p><p><b>— Charlotte Larcabal in the August 2018 YA Weekly article, </b><a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><b>“5 Places to Look When Hope Is Gone”</b></a></p><p>“When the Prophet [Joseph Smith] was under inspiration revising the New Testament, he paid careful attention to passages which contained the teachings of these principles. For example, in one of the more confusing biblical passages, <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Hebrews 6:1</a>, it reads,&nbsp;</p><p>“‘Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection.’ Joseph’s inspired translation inserts the word <i>not</i> before the phrase <i>leaving the principles.</i> Of this change he later commented: ‘If a man leaves the principles of the doctrine of Christ, how can he be saved in the principles? This is a contradiction. I don’t believe it. I will render it as it should be — ‘Therefore not leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.’”</p><p><b>— Richard E.

To say it is an anchor is to say it can keep us from drifting aimlessly or getting caught in whirlpools or running into sandbars. Hope, the anchor, is essential in this world so full of tidal waves. Sometimes those waves slap us from behind, sometimes we see them coming but cannot stop them or get out of the way. In all cases, hope ties us to safety. The waves come and go in their fury or playfulness, but hope is always there if we will but use this sure anchor.”</p><p><b>— Sister Elaine S.
