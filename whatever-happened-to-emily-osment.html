In 2007, she talked to <a href=#>ABC News</a> about adjusting to the fame, including the experience of seeing "7,000 people waiting outside the mall" for a Pennsylvania signing. The pressure wasn't easy for a kid in Hollywood. "It's hard because you're in the limelight constantly. You have to do everything right constantly," Emily explained at the time. Her life changed in noticeable ways as she left traditional school for private tutoring and tried to stay away from "snarky comments" and impersonators on the internet.</p><p dir=ltr>In the aforementioned ABC News interview, her dad, Eugene Osment, talked about helping her stay grounded and maintaining boundaries. Emily also shared that, even as a kid, she preferred "being busy" to "sitting and doing nothing." That love of keeping busy has stayed with Emily. When&nbsp;CBS asked her to give young actors advice years later, she said, "The best thing you can do is keep working and reading." She called the job "so cool" and something she hopes "to do forever."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>"That's the thing — if you love something and find it interesting, there's no reason to ever stop trying to get to the place that you want to be," she continued. "I'm working real, real hard to just keep working all the time on that dream. You never want to have any off days, until Christmas and maybe Thanksgiving." There's no doubt that Osment is a worker bee.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWlgbX9xe9ahmK2dppq%2FbrTAqaeeppWZerW7jJ6koqSpYry0ucSnq2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
