"I'm the one trying to get something, get a text back or get a call back or anything."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbXBlaIR3e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5zaKaoaeclsBurtGarKdn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
