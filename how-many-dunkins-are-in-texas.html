Fear not, fellow donut enthusiasts!

We're here to answer the age-old question that has kept many a Texan awake at night (probably after a sugar rush from a kolache, but that's a story for another time): <strong>just how many Dunkin' locations are there in the Lone Star State?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:62><strong>The Shocking Truth (Spoiler Alert: It's Not That Shocking)</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:324>Brace yourselves, donut detectives...there are a whopping <strong>196 Dunkin' Donuts</strong> scattered across the vast plains of Texas. That's right, folks, from El Paso to Houston, and everywhere in between, you can get your Dunkin' fix without having to wrestle a steer or dodge tumbleweeds (although, no promises on those last two).</p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:31><strong>Why So Many Dunkins, Y'all?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:221>Well, here's the thing: Texans love a good cup of joe, and Dunkin' delivers. Plus, let's be honest, sometimes you just need a classic glazed donut to go with your breakfast taco. It's a match made in Texan heaven, folks.</p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:48><strong>But Is That Enough? The Great Dunkin' Debate</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:211>Now, some folks (probably those who wear those fancy cowboy boots that cost more than a car) might argue that 196 Dunkin's just isn't enough. They might say, "We need more sprinkles in this state, dangnabbit!"</p><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:262>To those folks, I say this: <strong>Calm down, partner</strong>. There's plenty of Dunkin' to go around. Besides, Texas has its own donut royalty – the mighty kolache. Don't knock it till you try it, filled with everything from sausage to fruit, it's a true Texan treasure.</p><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:84><strong>The Verdict: Dunkin' Donuts in Texas – A Match Made in Sweet, Caffeinated Heaven</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:354>So, there you have it. Dunkin' Donuts is alive and well in Texas, offering a delicious counterpoint to the state's many other breakfast delights. Whether you're a die-hard Dunkin' fan or a curious kolache connoisseur, Texas has something for everyone. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a sudden craving for a donut...and maybe a kolache too.
