Below, we've rounded up everything we know about Miranda Derrick's whereabouts and whether she is still allegiant to the alleged cult now, two years after the three-part doc was filmed.</p><h2 id=who-is-miranda-derrick-nee-wilking-3>Who is Miranda Derrick (née Wilking)?</h2><p>Miranda Derrick (neé Wilking) was raised in suburban Michigan, where she and her younger sister, Melanie Wilking, began dancing as children. According to her family's interviews in Dancing for the Devil, in which Melanie, mom Kelly, and dad Dean participated, Miranda moved to Los Angeles to pursue dance professionally after graduating high school. Melanie followed soon after, and the sisters found success on social media, creating the joint profile "The Wilking Sisters."</p><p>In 2019, Miranda connected with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/bdash_2/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>James "BDash" Derrick</a> over Instagram DM, and the krump dancer collaborated with Miranda and Melanie on videos, before Miranda and BDash began dating. In late 2020, the couple started working with 7M Films, a new management company founded by Shekinah Church pastor Robert Shinn. They also joined Shinn's church and moved into a home that he owned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2xEhYukH7bTH5he2fNCfQW-1920-80.jpg><p>In February 2022, Melanie, Kelly, and Dean Wilking took part in an <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CaYQL7dJ9DR/?utm_medium=copy_link" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Instagram Live</a> where they shared their allegations that Miranda had become part of a "cult," claiming that she, BDash, and the other dancers in 7M were allegedly under Shinn's control. They said that Miranda Derrick had cut all ties to the family after officially signing with 7M in January 2021, adding that they believed she had been “brainwashed” by the organization.</p><p>Following the Instagram Live, several outlets including <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/7m-films-tiktok-dance-cult-allegations-miranda-wilking-james-derrick-1323200/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Rolling Stone</a> and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.thecut.com/2024/06/wilking-sisters-7m-allegations.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>The Cut</a> published exposés on the group and Robert Shinn's alleged history of abuse, including a former lawsuit brought against him by an ex-Shekinah member. Several dancers left 7M in the months prior, and in 2023, a group of dancers and former church members <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/7m-dancers-sue-alleging-robert-shinn-runs-cult-1234701158/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>filed a (still ongoing) lawsuit</a> claiming that Shinn and other defendants subjected people “to brainwashing, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, manipulation, and exploitation.”</p><h2 id=is-miranda-derrick-still-a-member-of-the-alleged-39-7m-tiktok-cult-39-3>Is Miranda Derrick still a member of the alleged '7M TikTok Cult'?</h2><p>As of the docuseries' May 29 release, Miranda Derrick still appears to be a member of 7M Films. Though the company's <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.7mfilms.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>website</a> does not have an official roster, she and BDash have credited Robert Shinn's son <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/isaiahshinn/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Isaiah</u></a> for <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/p/C7Mrb7OxaaE/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>filming several recent videos</u></a>, many of which match the 7M filming and content style (such as dances to older songs). She also appears to collaborate with other dancers allegedly under 7M Films, including <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/itsslavik/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Vik White</a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.youtube.com/@RainODancer/shorts referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>RainO</a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/mizzk.o/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Kendra "KO" Willis</a>, and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/officialtighteyex/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Ceasare “Tighteyex” Willis</a>.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

The couple was later married, though it is unclear when the ceremony was. Earlier this year, the pair shared <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/p/C5OhS9lxtpX/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>throwback photos</a> of themselves dressed in wedding attire. As of June 2024, the Derricks are still married and based in Los Angeles.</p><h2 id=has-miranda-derrick-responded-to-39-dancing-for-the-devil-the-7m-tiktok-cult-39-3>Has Miranda Derrick responded to 'Dancing for the Devil: The 7M TikTok Cult?'</h2><p>Several days after Dancing for the Devil premiered, Miranda shared a statement on social media on June 4. According to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.glamour.com/story/miranda-derrick-breaks-her-silence-on-dancing-for-the-devil-documentary-and-allegations-shes-in-a-cult referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Glamour</a>, she denied that she belonged to a cult and attributed the tension between her and her family members to be about her faith.</p><p>She wrote on her Instagram Stories, "I just wanted to hop on here really quick and first of all say thank you to everybody who’s been so supportive during this time. In the next couple slides I’ve included my statement of this documentary that’s just been released. I can’t go into too much detail because of legal purposes, but I wanted to add my side of the story a little bit."</p><p>"I have been getting together with them over the past couple years to make amends, move on and work things out as a family,” she continued. “This documentary has created a further challenge between us as I work to overcome this public attack. No one likes to be portrayed as their brainwashed/not in control of her own life/shell of herself/human trafficked daughter/sister when that just isn’t the truth.”</p><p>The dancer posted the statement nearly a week after the docuseries' premiere. Before speaking out, she continued to share content centered on her routines, including one clip featuring her husband BDash, soundtracked by <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/sabrina-carpenter-romantic-partner-traits/>Sabrina Carpenter</a>'s "Espresso." Comments have also been limited under her posts.</p><p>Fans also speculated that Miranda could have subtly shaded the docuseries in a June 1 shared <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/p/C7rugvIPMtN/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>post</a>, where she collaborates with another alleged 7M dancer, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@mizzk.o?lang=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Kendra “KO” Willis</u></a>. Willis captioned the post, "Dancing it out with my sis by my side," which some have seen as a possible indirect criticism of Miranda's sister Melanie.</p><p>Miranda's recent statement is not the first time she's denied her involvement in the alleged cult. In May 2022, following her family's Instagram Live, she denied all allegations in a statement to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.thecut.com/2022/05/wilking-sisters-7m-allegations.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>The Cut</u></a>.</p><p>"I am not held against my will and I've never been a hostage," she said. "I go to church and I have faith in God. If one day I wish to pursue my faith elsewhere, I will and feel completely free to do that. As far as my career, my time at 7M Films has been one of the most exciting years ever and if one day I wish to partner with a different management company or start my own company, I will. No one is forcing me to do anything. I am excited to move forward in this incredible walk with God, an amazing marriage and exciting career. I’m also looking forward to moving past all of this and mend my relationship with my family privately."</p><p>7M Films have also spoken out about the Wilkings' concerns. In a 2022 statement to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-cult-claims-surrounding-miranda-derrick-and-her-tiktok-dance-crew-7m-films referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>The Daily Beast</a>, a representative for 7M Films said, “Miranda Derrick is a successful businesswoman and a loving wife and daughter who cares very much about her family. While the recent portrayals of Dr. Robert Shinn and 7M Films have been wildly offensive and riddled with inaccuracies, those false claims will not deter 7M from supporting Miranda in whichever endeavors she chooses to pursue next.”</p><h2 id=what-is-miranda-derrick-39-s-relationship-with-her-family-3>What is Miranda Derrick's relationship with her family?</h2><p>As seen in the documentary, Miranda Derrick eventually reconnected with her family after a period of estrangement, and the Wilking family is still in contact with her today. However, in the doc, Melanie Wilking says that her relationship with her sister feels superficial and admits that she hesitates to include Miranda in major life events, such as her then-upcoming wedding.</p><p>On June 2, 2024, Melanie shared her first public statement since filming the documentary, via her Instagram stories. Per <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.glamour.com/story/melanie-wilking-gives-followers-an-update-about-her-relationship-with-sister-miranda-derrick referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Glamour</a>, Melanie (who now does by her husband Austin Ekeler's surname) thanked viewers for the support she and her family have received since Dancing for the Devil premiered on Netflix, while also speaking out on her relationship with Miranda.</p><p>“Thankfully, since going public in 2022, we have reunited with my sister, who even attended my wedding,” Melanie wrote. “We believe that one day my sister and the other victims will realize their love for their families and faith was exploited. When that happens, we will be there for them without judgment."</p><p>Since then, Melanie <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.glamour.com/story/melanie-wilking-miranda-dancing-for-the-devil-interview referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>opened up to Glamour</a> in an interview, reportedly conducted on June 5 and published on June 6, about reuniting with her sister on her wedding day. She confirmed that Miranda and BDash both attended the ceremony on May 25 (just days before the docuseries dropped), which she called "truly the best day of my life."</p><p>She told the outlet that her "interactions were very positive" with her sister, adding, "I'm glad we can share that memory together.”</p><p>Miranda, meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/itsmirandaderrick/p/C7e3VsSvDXX/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>posted</a> pictures from the venue.</p><p>Melanie also explained to Glamour that she and her sister have not continued talking since Dancing for the Devil premiered. She said, "Sadly, I did reach out but I have not heard back."</p><p>She noted that she does not believe Miranda has actually watched the three-parter, despite her recent statement. "I feel it is very clear that she did not watch it because it’s so much bigger than just our family situation," she explained. "It goes so much deeper into that and if you watch the documentary, you would know that. So it’s very sad to me, it was very sad when I read that. And it’s like, I do not believe that she watched it."</p><p>While there continues to be a rift between the Wilkings sisters and Melanie said she's "not too sure" if contact will continue, she also expressed hopefulness. She shared, "I’m hopeful that we will stay in contact. I don’t necessarily know what that looks like. But I’ve never lost hope that we will get our relationship back."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRoq69lo528uL%2BOsJ%2BeqpVitrR5zKKpmqaUlnqlsdGroJyjXay2rbfIp55mnJGjsKq6xmadqKpdqbWmecOeraKkXam1pnmWpmStoZupvKx5wq6jrWWepMRw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
