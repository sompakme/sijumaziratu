He said in part:</p>“My name is Terna Mbakorkaa Tarka, I am a Nigerian who firmly believes in unity and respect for humanity regardless of race, tribe, gender or religion, I am here today to address a very controversial narrative that has been making rounds all over social media and the news. This is regarding a statement that when Tiv men host their guests, they give their wives out to these guests for pleasure purposes. Speaking as a proud Tiv man, who was born into one of the prominent families to come out of the middle belt region and the first grandson of Joseph Zawan Tarka. I would like to categorically state that in all my years of hosting my guests, even the thought of such a derogatory practice has never crossed my mind, therefore such a thing never occurred in my marriage. Coming from a prominent Tiv family, it is easy to be the target of the backlash regarding this matter but on the other hand I’m also well placed to speak on behalf of all Tiv people when I state clearly that such a practice has never occurred or existed within the Tiv culture or any other Nigerian culture for that matter.”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a3b04bd5bd21718f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"I married secretly and divorced secretly": Mark Angel breaks net with bombshell about his love life</span></p></a><p class=align-left>See his<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> full video </a>below:</p><h2>Netizens react to Venita’s ex-husband’s video</h2><p class=align-left>The video of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Venita’s ex-husband </a>setting the record straight about his Tiv culture went viral and it got some Nigerians talking.
