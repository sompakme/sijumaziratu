"A place where private family matters aren't thrown on the world stage for all to poke and pick apart. In an effort to protect that space for her, I agreed to not contest claims arising from an argument I had with a family member of my partner's who entered our home while my partner was away several weeks ago."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His tweet continued, saying that he hopes that everyone involved can heal from the incident and that whatever happened "leaked" without his knowledge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This was and still should be a private matter but it seems for now there is divisiveness and despite my efforts to restore us to a peaceful family environment that will allow for me to co-parent my daughter in a manner in which she deserves, this has been 'leaked' to the press," his tweet finished.
