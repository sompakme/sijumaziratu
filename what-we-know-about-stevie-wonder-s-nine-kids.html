His eldest, Aisha Morris (pictured above), is now in her late 40s, and like Stevie, is a talented performer and singer.&nbsp;She famously served as the inspiration for Stevie's smash hit "Isn't She Lovely"&nbsp;which he released in 1976, a year after Aisha was born. While she didn't end up pursuing a music career,&nbsp;Aisha has been nominated for a Grammy for&nbsp;Best R&B Performance By A Duo&nbsp;for her duet of "How Will I Know" with Stevie back in 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, her brother, Keita, also shares their dad's love for music and is&nbsp;a professional DJ, producer, and songwriter. In 2009, Keita made headlines after he was arrested&nbsp;on charges of domestic violence in Los Angeles, as reported previously by&nbsp;<a href=#>TMZ</a>. Born in 1977, Keita is now a father to a teenage son named Asmar and a young daughter named Lula Mae. As for Stevie's third child, Mumtaz has similarly taken after their father's footsteps and is an R&B&nbsp;artist, according to <a href=#>Black Image</a> magazine. In 2009, Mumtaz joined his father onstage&nbsp;for a live performance of his song "Ribbon in The Sky" during Stevie's concert at the Hollywood Bowl (via <a href=#>YouTube</a>). In his interview with Black Image, Mumtaz said he had no interest in music growing up and had wanted to pursue a career in sports instead. "I used to sway away from music, because it was something my dad did — and I wanted to make my own career path," Mumtaz said. He studied business at a college in Virginia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtoaoF5go6sq56umZp6uLvNnZyrZZ6eu6Z5yqKbrGWnna61edaeZKSmn6x8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
