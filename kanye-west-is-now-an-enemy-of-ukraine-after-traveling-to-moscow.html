A large crowd awaited his departure from a hotel in Moscow, earlier this week. In addition to meeting with Rubchinsky, it's unclear what else he has planned for his time in the country. He previously praised its leader, Vladimir Putin, during an interview with Drink Champs, last year. In doing so, he described himself as “Young Putin” and added: “Culture is an oil. Culture is an energy, and I’m the king of culture for the past 20 and the next 2,000 years.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kanye-west-becomes-an-enemy-of-ukraine>Kanye West Becomes An Enemy Of Ukraine</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">West's trip to Moscow comes after a group of former employees <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">filed a lawsuit against him</a> claiming he and former chief of staff Milo Yiannopoulos fostered “a racist environment." Additionally, Ye's wife, Bianca Censori, is alleged to have sent “one worker a file-sharing link containing hardcore sexual activity." Yiannopoulos has already denied the accusations.
