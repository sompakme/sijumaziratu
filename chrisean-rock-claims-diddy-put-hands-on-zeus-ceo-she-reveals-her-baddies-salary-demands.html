Chrisean has vowed to not do the show because she doesn't think the show is paying her what she actually deserves. This led to a series of Instagram stories from Palmer, who said "we make smart investments. Not emotional, impulsive, or erratic ones." This subsequently led to a long video from Chrisean in which she explained some of the numbers, and even invoked a story involving none other than <a href=# class=text-word rel>Diddy</a>.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>What Show Is Chrisean Rock In?</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chrisean-rock-speaks>Chrisean Rock Speaks</h2></span><p>As Chrisean explains, the network wants to pay her $100K per episode. However, when she did a recent season while pregnant, she was getting $150K. Furthermore, if she were to come back, she would want somewhere in the range of $200-$300K. As for Diddy, she says Palmer and Chrisean were at a Diddy party one night, and Lemuel went to exchange some pleasantries. Upon thanking Diddy for liking Chrisean, Rock alleges that Diddy grabbed Palmer by the neck and asked if he messed with her too. He then warned Palmer that Chrisean is not to be played with and that she needs to be treated right.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lemuel-palmer-s-side-of-things>Lemuel Palmer's Side Of Things</h2></span><p>It is unclear what Chrisean's goal was by delivering this story, however, it is clear she believes it is some sort of leverage.
