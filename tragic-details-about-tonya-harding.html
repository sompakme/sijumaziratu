In Lynda Prouse's biography, "<a href=#>The Tonya Tapes</a>," and in a later interview with <a href=#>The University of Oregan School of Law</a>, Harding claimed her half brother, Chris Davison, molested her repeatedly, starting when she was five years old. Later, when Harding was 15 years old and Davison was 26, he allegedly tried to sexually assault her once more, reported&nbsp;<a href=#>Sports Illustrated</a>&nbsp;in 1992. Harding was getting ready "for her first date" with future husband Jeff Gillooly when Davison allegedly came home drunk and "tried to kiss her." To escape, Harding claimed she burned him with her curling iron, locked herself in her bathroom, hit him with a hockey stick, called the police, and ran to a neighbor's house. Davidson was arrested and jailed, but Harding's mother downplayed the incident as a figment of Harding's "vivid imagination."</p><p dir=ltr>Gillooly used a similar denial after Harding accused him and two other men of <a href=#>raping her at gunpoint</a>. She also claimed&nbsp;"a friend" previously raped her during a time when she was separated from Gillooly. Harding said she didn't go to authorities, because&nbsp;Gillooly threatened her, and she was also fearful of damaging her career, since at the time she was a "national champion."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>In one of his only on-the-record interviews,&nbsp;Gillooly shrugged off Harding's rape accusation, telling <a href=#>Deadspin</a>,&nbsp;"I forgot about that. I think I kind of laughed about it. ...&nbsp;It's a big story, and obviously her accusations didn't carry much weight with any type of authority."</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
