Pettaway heard her singing while pumping gas and decided to be his producer.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Career</span></strong></h2><p><span>Toni Braxton’s self-titled debut album was released in 1993 and was a huge success, peaking at number one on the US Billboard 200 album chart.&nbsp;Next, she released her song titled&nbsp;</span><span>Another Sad Love Song</span><span>&nbsp;which reached another peak of excellence on the Top 100 Billboard and R&B Singles charts.&nbsp;Her music albums include&nbsp;</span><span>Toni Braxton</span><span>&nbsp;(1993),&nbsp;</span><span>Secrets</span><span>&nbsp;(1996),&nbsp;</span><span>The Heat</span><span>&nbsp;(2000),&nbsp;</span><span>Snowflakes</span><span>&nbsp;(2001),&nbsp;</span><span>More Than A Woman</span><span>&nbsp;(2002),&nbsp;</span><span>Libra</span><span>&nbsp;(2005),&nbsp;</span><span>Pulse</span><span>&nbsp;(2010),&nbsp;</span><span>Love, Marriage and Divorce</span><span>&nbsp;(with Baby Face, 2014) and</span><span>Sex and Cigarettes</span><span>&nbsp;(2018).</span></p><p><span>Braxton plays the keyboard and was the first woman to sign with Laface Records.&nbsp;She starred as Belle in the Broadway production of&nbsp;</span><span>Beauty and the Beast</span><span>&nbsp;in September 1998.

She denied the allegations until they were made public in 2008, when a benign lump was removed from her breast.&nbsp;In 2010, Braxton was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus;&nbsp;a very deadly disease.&nbsp;According to the research carried out, the disease was historic in his family because his brother is a carrier and his uncle died of its complications.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Husband, sons and children of Toni Braxton</span></strong></h2><p><span>Toni Braxton was married to Keri Lewis in April 2001.&nbsp;The two met while on an open tour and kicked off a romance that took them down the aisle.&nbsp;Their union was blessed with two boys – the first they named Denim Cole Braxton Lewis was born in 2001 and the second Diezel Ky Braxton-Lewis was born in 2003.</span></p><p><span>Her second son Diezel was diagnosed with autism, which motivated her mom to join the Autism Responders where she serves as an international spokesperson.&nbsp;Braxton announced her separation from husband Keri Lewis in November 2009 and later officially divorced in July 2013.</span></p><h2><strong><span>father and sisters</span></strong></h2><p><span>Toni Braxton was born to her father MichaelCornard Braxton Sr., a Methodist Center clergyman who also worked with a power company.&nbsp;His mother is Evelyn Jackson, an opera singer and cosmetologist who was also a pastor.&nbsp;Ironically, Braxton was born into a spiritual and Christian home because apart from her pastor parents, her maternal grandfather was also a pastor.&nbsp;It has been said that the upbringing received by Braxton and his siblings was of the strictest nature as they were never allowed to listen to any type of music apart from gospel/divine music.</span></p><p><span>Braxton has six siblings and she is the oldest in the mall.&nbsp;She has a brother Micheal Junior born in 1968 and four younger sisters Tarci, Towanda, Trina and Tarma, born in 1971, 1973, 1974 and 1977 respectively.</span></p><p><span>Growing up, Braxton wasn’t alone in her love for music.&nbsp;Along with her four sisters, they started singing in the late 1980s under the stage name The Braxtons, producing their debut album&nbsp;</span><span>Good Life</span><span>&nbsp;in 1990. The album didn’t do so well, but it gave Toni Braxton the right amount of exposure.&nbsp;Soon the producers came looking for her and this led her to record the soundtrack for Eddy Murphy’s movie&nbsp;</span><span>Boomerang</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Toni Braxton Dating Again?&nbsp;– Boyfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>In 2016, news emerged that Toni Braxton is in a relationship with rapper, record producer and entrepreneur Birdman whose birth name is Bryan Williams.&nbsp;They have been together since 2016 but finally announced their engagement at the February 2018 Grammy Awards.</span></p><p><span>Birdman is worth over $160 million and is the co-founder of cash money records and one half of the duo Big Tymers.&nbsp;In addition to music, the rapper has also been identified as a marijuana hauler after he was caught with a pound of marijuana in 2007.
