Prior to that, I had never travelled outside the southwest. I lived and grew up in Ibadan, Oyo state."When I got my call-up letter to Akwa Ibom, I was super excited. I would say that was the turning point for me. It was thrilling to experience a new culture, a new way of life, a new environment. It did something to me. It opened my mind and changed my perspective. "During my service year, I travelled to other neighbouring states as well; Enugu, Anambra, Cross-River and gradually, I found myself always super excited whenever I was about to take on another travelling adventure.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/37c336beda4f23c0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Coup d'état: ECOWAS military chiefs agree on date to invade Niger</span></p></a><p class=align-left>With the passport she has acquired, Tomison said she will soon embark on a tour of <a href=#>Benin</a> Republic.</p><p class=align-left>She told <strong>Legit.ng:</strong></p>"I completed my service, came back home(even though I really didn’t want to) and continued exploring different places around me. Very recently, a lot of people have been visiting Benin Republic, and I thought it would also be nice to also visit this country and see what life is like outside Nigeria. "I'm really looking forward to this trip as it will be my first time travelling outside Nigeria. I wouldn't say I have certain expectations. I just have an open mind, and I'm ready to experience a new culture, eat new food, and see how life is lived here."<p class=align-left><strong>Watch the video below:</strong></p><h2>Reactions as lady gets her ECOWAS passport within two hours</h2><p class=align-left>@Jennifer said:</p>"I need mine ASAP."<p class=align-left>@finest0582 reacted:</p>"I'm doing this ASAP."<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c30254dce39d2ab8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigerian man in UK shows fat cheque company sent to his house abroad, encourages people to relocate</span></p></a><p class=align-left>@ÀBÉNÌÀDÉ said:</p>"I will save this for later."<p class=align-left>@NGOZI said:</p>"This is the first time I am hearing about this."<h2>Nigerian lady visits Republic of Guinea</h2><p class=align-left>In a related story, <strong>Legit.ng </strong>reported that a Nigerian <a href=# rel=noopener>lady travelled to the Republic of Guinea.</a></p><p class=align-left>She discovered that their <a href=#>currency</a> is very weak to the Naira.</p><p class=align-left>When she converted N150k to the Guinean Franc, she had about N1.5 million in her hands.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkvaa7z6WcaGllaYVxgJZmoGaokajAsbvRrWRrZZikwrO%2FjKWYnbFdmrCww8CsZK2qkauyrXnPmqqsqJ%2BnwW6ywKyrZpmgpbmqr8CtoKimXau2pbHOZq2iqpGhfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
