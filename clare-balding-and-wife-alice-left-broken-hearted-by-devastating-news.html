His grandfather was Fabulous Willie, who won Crufts in 2007."</p><p id=eNZAlwLAh70y data-wc=68>Speaking about how she dealt with the tragic loss of her other dog Percy, Clare added: "My father wrote me a very good letter after Percy got killed and he said 'you can't replace him but you can fill the hole he has left'. I couldn't bear coming downstairs in the morning to an empty house and not having a reason to go for a walk every day.</p><p id=elb5CpU4nZix data-wc=69>"We got Archie fairly soon afterwards and I'm so glad we did. I think it will be different when Archie's time comes because he's so much older and has been part of our lives for 15 years. We have photos and pictures of him all over the house so he will always be with us. I suspect we will have a gap before we think about getting another dog."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
