Once again, he made it to the finale ... though this time, he walked away a champion. However, winning the prize was just part of what motivated his return. Asked by <a href=#>DigitalSpy</a> about the deciding factor in entering again, Guerra revealed that it was all about the platform. "Even going into Season 8, I never thought of it as an opportunity to win a big prize and that's about it. It was an opportunity to be visible," he told the outlet. It was a sentiment he doubled down on in an interview with <a href=#>The Cut</a>. "It was really just an opportunity and a platform to exhibit my talents," he said, adding that winning was an unexpected (though certainly welcome) addition to that.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, gain a platform, he certainly did! At the time of writing, his online store has sold out of most items, and in January 2023, he exhibited at New York Fashion Week. Oh, and he's also thrown a few "lewks"&nbsp;together for another reality competition show –&nbsp;<a href=#>"RuPaul's Drag Race."</a>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamphaX56gI6wn5qslauys3nHmqepnZ6asW7AzmakqKaUpHqowcSrqZpllqe8rnnPq6ajnZOperPBzbCYsmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
