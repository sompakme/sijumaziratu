In 1982, there were no restaurants with an open kitchen. Today, there is virtually no restaurant without an open kitchen.” Spago’s first mention in the press came in THR in a Jan. 26 George Christy column that declared it “the newest celebrity in town” and “the latest hottest hangout.” Among the early celebs in attendance, Christy noted, were “Lizzie Montgomery,” the star of Bewitched, and Alana Stewart, then married to Rod Stewart.</p><p>Paparazzi soon flocked to the parking lot to snap photos of A-list regulars like Johnny Carson, Michael Caine, Dolly Parton, Burt Reynolds, Sylvester Stallone, Barbra Streisand, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. But all were welcome, assuming you could snag a reservation — with one notable exception: Patrick Terrail, Puck’s former boss at Ma Maison, who was 86’d. In 1997, Spago relocated to its current location on Canon Drive in Beverly Hills.</p><p>Of its enduring success, Puck says: “We are in the hospitality business. We want to make the guests feel good.”</p><p>This story first appeared in the Jan. 12 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. <a href=#>Click here to subscribe.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvLop2eq6SuuaZ5zZ6urGejpa6ou4yrnKyskaq%2ForrTZq6opJacrq%2BzjKmsnKNdZn90gY9wamlrZGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
