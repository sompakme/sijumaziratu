Even with government changes, wars beginning or ending, and all the various events that happen throughout the years, many stations keep broadcasting all the same, which is why at least a few numbers stations are suspected to be "dead hand" systems, meaning that as long as they continue broadcasting, everything is a-okay. But if they ever stop, that means something has gone terribly wrong, according to <a href=#>Global News</a>.</p><p>But occasionally, a major world event has marked a noted change in a numbers station's broadcast. In 1993, an attempted military coup in the former Soviet Union, then under President Boris Yeltsin, seemed to cause various numbers stations located in the country to change their broadcasts to repeat the number "five" over and over until the crisis was settled, according to <a href=#>Slate</a>. No one knows what that means, exactly, but it's definitely very spooky, sort of like a real-life version of <a href=#>Emperor Palpatine</a> sending out his Order 66 message to all of the clones in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BlG9tcGpfqbWmecGisZqqopp6rsXSrZyrsV2Xsqm1zZ1kraCVYru2ucGeqaxlo6mutbXOp6po</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
