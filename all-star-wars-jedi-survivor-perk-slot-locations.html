The game is a direct sequel to the highly successful Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Something that helped is that a lot of players enjoyed the fact that they were able to keep all of their Force Powers from the previous game.</p><p>One thing that reviewers enjoyed about the previous game is that it was <a href=#>actually difficult</a> on higher difficulties. The same can be said about Jedi Survivor. To do well in Jedi Survivor, you will need all the equipment you can get to make yourself stronger. Here, we are going to tell you <strong>where you need to go to increase your perk slots in Jedi Survivor</strong>.</p><h2><strong>All Jedi Survivor Perk Slot Upgrade Locations</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/TqHrSCvw2i84uVmOraZkNyeClZxtTLrqL3RHnovIb6s/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9TdGFyX1dhcnMvUGVya19TbG90X1VwZ3JhZGVzL3N0YXJfd2Fyc19zdXJ2aXZvcl9wZXJrX3Nsb3RzXzRfc2l6ZS5qcGc><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Jedi Survivor</a>, you are going to get a lot of different upgrades to make the game easier on yourself. For example, you will eventually unlock the ability to equip perks. But to start, you will only have three perk slots to use. That's not nearly enough, but luckily there are perk upgrades you can pick up to get more perk slots. Here's <strong>where you need to go to find all the perk upgrades in Jedi Survivor</strong>:</p><ul><li>Koboh at Zee's Shop in Pyloon's Saloon</li><li>Koboh, Harvest Ridge</li><li>Koboh, Derelict Dam</li><li>Koboh, Smuggler's Tunnel</li><li>Jedha, Path of Restoration</li><li>Jedha, Path of Persistence</li><li>Jedha, Path of Conviction</li></ul><p>As you can see, there are only two planets where you can find perk slot upgrades. The ones on Jedha are pretty easy to get as they only really require you to solve some puzzles to get the perk upgrades. The ones on Koboh can be difficult as <strong>you will need certain force upgrades to reach the perk ypgrade</strong>.</p><h2><strong>How Many Perks Slots Are There In Jedi Survivor?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/4dDdwf4NT1IMF3cLGiVUNwcZbbNbbRW8fB73xAxP2DY/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9TdGFyX1dhcnMvUGVya19TbG90X1VwZ3JhZGVzL3N0YXJfd2Fyc19zdXJ2aXZvcl9wZXJrX3Nsb3RzXzJfc2l6ZS5qcGc><p><strong>You will start out with 3 perk slots to choose from</strong>. Some perks will take up multiple slots if they are of a better quality. Some defensive perk upgrades will even take up to three perk slots to use. So you will want to upgrade your perk slots as soon as possible to become stronger.</p><p>In total, <strong>you can have 10 perk slots in Jedi Survivor</strong>. Having a wide range of perks that you can choose from is important to make sure you can adapt to any situation. You might want to switch stances and use your perks to help you become stronger in that Lightsaber stance. Or maybe you want to go with an all-out defense to become more resistant to enemies.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/2qTcliBkdQ2tt-IwTfnfNqnLcqX9oyo7hz8UfmwTOtk/rs:fill:180:180:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8xX1N0YWZmX1Bob3Rvcy9kYW5pZWxfYm9yamFzLmpwZw alt="Daniel Borjas" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXNsWWtrl%2Bau3C%2F05qpZq%2BRp8ButsSdoGarpafDqsLOq2aapJxivaa%2BymaqpaekYrmwr8CtoKimow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
