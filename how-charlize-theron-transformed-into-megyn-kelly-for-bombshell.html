To play the famous real-life newscasters, both Theron and Kidman wore a number of facial prosthetics and wigs. The result? Theron was completely unrecognizable in her new role. Transforming famous, recognizable women such as Theron and Kidman into equally famous, recognizable woman like Kelly and Carlson is a considerable feat; which is why director Jay Roach, and Theron — who was a producer on the film — had to tap a Hollywood hair and makeup dream team to get the looks just right."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"Charlize wanted to look like Megyn and not herself when she was practicing her voice and lines in front of the mirror," says Hiro. "Both Charlize and Megyn are really famous and everyone knows what they look like, so because of this, I knew creating the prosthetics was going to be challenging."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first piece Hiro made for Theron was a nose plug, because she has much smaller nostrils than Kelly. To create it, he took a cast of the inside of her nose, made a 3D scan model, changed the shape as necessary on a computer, then printed it out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the end, Theron's final look included the plug, plus additional pieces on her eyelids, nose bridge, cheeks, jaw, and a nose tip. Along with the eight prosthetics, she also wore dark contact lenses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But managing to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>look unrecognizable</a> on-screen took a few times to get right, Hiro shares. "Charlize’s makeup was tricky because there were so many pieces," he explains. "When I applied all the pieces during the makeup test, she thought she looked like a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>young Glenn Close</a>. It's embarrassing to hear her say that!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, Hiro made modifications throughout the makeup and film tests and even during filming. "Drastically changing eyelids is something I've never done before," he adds. "I think I went through six different versions of eyelids — including after we started filming. I think I changed them twice then."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To make things more complicated, Theron's actual makeup had to jive with all of the prosthetics, too. "Putting makeup on top of prosthetics is a surefire way you’re going to see them," explains Baker. "I needed to devise a way to build a makeup over them, so I had to take into consideration how the makeup lands on the skin and how it does on the pieces."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it came to the character's hair, Morgan used Kelly's various hairstyles as a means to help the audience feel empathy towards the famous news anchor. During the story timeline in the film, Kelly has various looks from long, blonde extensions to her layered pixie cut — a bold move for an anchor at Fox, where during the network's peak, lots of blonde hair was essentially a job requirement for female newscasters.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Along with wigs and extensions, Morgan made Theron's face look more heart-shaped like Kelly's by lowering her hairline. "I thought it was important to have those little onion layers in her hairstyles," says Morgan. "You have her long hair with a little bit of extensions and then she has a ton of extensions in during the first debate with Trump. Her short cut was so ballsy for her to do because nobody was doing that. I thought that was her trying to be taken seriously as a real journalist."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Nicole Kidman as Gretchen Carlson</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Lionsgate/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Kidman's prosthetics were much more simple to create, the team only had a month and a half to finalize her look due to tight scheduling. "I designed her face with cheek pieces because Gretchen Carlson has a rounder face compared to Nicole," says Hiro. "After Nicole and Jay had a meeting about the look, we ended up just using a nose and chin piece." During the test makeup, Baker made some improvements to the original makeup look to improve Kidman's likeness to Carlson.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because Kidman joined the film late and had so many other projects in the works, the actress brought on hairstylist Kim Santantonio, whom she often works with, and wore one wig styled by Santantonio. "Carlson's hair is an early Fox look," says Morgan. "It's very helmet-like hair; kind of like the old regime."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: “Bombshell” Director Says Charlize Theron Insisted on Keeping the Movie as Creepy as Possible</strong></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Margot Robbie as Kayla Pospisil</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Hilary B Gayle/Lionsgate</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike her co-stars, Robbie's character, Kayla Pospisil, a newbie Fox staffer, is fictional. Her story arc is a representation of the younger women at the network, whose career goals are dependent on surrendering to the network's unequal power dynamics and becoming a victim of the cyclical sexual harassment and abuse that takes place.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the film, Robbie's look is young, millennial, and inspired in part by beauty influencers on Instagram and YouTube. "There’s a big similarity between news anchors and Instagram makeup," says Baker. "Some aspects of news makeup is out of a genuine need, because anchors are in front of the cameras and there's lots of lights. There's a need for a lot more base makeup."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Baker changed Robbie's makeup throughout the film based on her character's development from a wide-eyed want-to-be Fox News anchor to finally getting in front of the camera once she paid the price to advance her career.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In the first half of the movie Kayla still has fake lashes on — they’re little strips and they weren't perfectly placed so it came off like she was so cute, adorable, and wide-eyed," explains Baker. "After she gets what she wants by paying a heavy price, the mask comes on because she’s going to be on camera. It’s strong and heavy, but to me it’s symbolic because it hides the shame of what she did in order to get there."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Robbie's makeup is at its most natural (and relatable) when her character quits Fox at the end of the film, symbolizing the new woman she's become, unaware of her next career move.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for Robbie's hair, her white-blonde color was styled in long waves. At the beginning of the film, it looks like Pospisil is styling her own hair, but when she moves to Bill O'Reilly's department, she starts getting blowouts with bouncy waves as part of her strategy to get noticed, and eventually, get in front of the camera.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLCprdGloLOdXam1pr7Op2SmnZeuu263xKWjsmWSpLqjv8eeo6VlpKeur7%2FFqKmmmaSevK8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
