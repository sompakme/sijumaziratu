The video appears to confirm what has long been a part of Aussie folklore — a large, distinctly non-domestic cat roaming in Sydney’s Upper North Shore.

She said she’d been close by when she made the sighting, about “eight or 10 steps” away, but was behind a glass door.</p><p>Rebecca said she’d contacted local authorities at the time who’d told her they’d received reports about big cats “from time to time”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7056aoaafobyoxY6smqKdnpiycK3NoqSapKNkr6qzjJyYratdqLaotNOipaCrXZe5oq%2FKZqeapqSdsrN5wpqsoKCkYryvedWim56nXZ67br%2FYnaWesaNiu7C%2B06FkrKCfp7JwusSwqmarpKS%2FunuPnWdtbpRtfaV%2FwWmccG5kmH9yrZFxbpprlZt9d33Bcg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
