A name that rolls off the tongue like a rogue tumbleweed on a dusty highway. But beneath that deceptively fun-to-say moniker lies a city with a heart (and square mileage) that might surprise you. So, how big is this Texas town, anyway? Let's dive in, saddle up, and answer the question that's been keeping you up at night (or maybe it was just that extra helping of chili cheese fries).</p><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:56>Square Meals, Square Miles: Size Matters (Sometimes)</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:369>Pflugerville isn't exactly sprawling like a lone cowboy's hat over a vast prairie. According to the official tally, it clocks in at around <strong>22.32 square miles</strong>. That's a decent chunk of land, enough to fit a whole lotta barbecue pits, two-step dance floors, and maybe even a place to practice your lasso skills (though we recommend against that in the city limits).</p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:340>But here's the thing: Pflugerville is a growing town, faster than a greased pig in a sack race. They say everything's bigger in Texas, and Pflugerville might be taking that motto to heart. Estimates suggest the city could be pushing closer to <strong>25.57 square miles</strong> these days. That's like adding in an extra Whataburger for good measure!</p><h3 data-sourcepos=11:1-11:67>Don't Get Lost in the Shuffle: Pflugerville's Population Punch</h3><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:347>Now, size ain't everything, as they say (especially when it comes to belt buckles). What about the folks who call Pflugerville home? Well, as of 2023, the estimate is somewhere around <strong>79,668 residents</strong>. That's a healthy community, with enough friendly faces to fill a Friday night football stadium (and maybe a few extra for the cheerleaders).</p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:247>Here's the kicker: Pflugerville is growing faster than bluebonnets blooming in spring. So, that population number? It might be a little outdated by the time you read this. Just remember, this town's got some serious movin' and groovin' going on.</p><h3 data-sourcepos=17:1-17:72>The Verdict: Pflugerville's Not Tiny, But It Ain't Texas-Sized (Yet)</h3><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:217>So, Pflugerville isn't a megalopolis, but it's definitely not a one-horse town either. It's a place with a growing heart, a friendly atmosphere, and enough space to spread out without feeling lost in the tumbleweeds.</p><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:197>Is it the biggest city in Texas? Nope. But hey, who needs to be the biggest when you can be the friendliest, the tastiest (thanks to all that barbecue!), and the one with the most fun-to-say name?</p><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:223>Pflugerville might not be on every map, but it's definitely a place worth exploring. Just remember to pack your boots, your appetite, and maybe a good sense of humor – this Texas town is sure to leave a lasting impression.</p>7826505337726088165<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWxfnby4ecGinmaho2K9p7jUoJyrrpmhuaZ5056vmqtencGuuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
