And I’m thinking, ‘What am I gonna do?’ I had to come up with something that was distinctive enough, so I thought, ‘OK, now, so what happens to this guy?’ He gets bit in the neck, he’s bit in the leg, he’s shot in the arm, so basically, the zombie image came out of the wounds that he received.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">David Michael Emge was born in Evansville, Illinois, on Sept. 9, 1946, to Richard Andrew and Gertrude Mary Emge.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He graduated with a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Evansville, where he studied drama. While in college, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and served during the Vietnam War.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">His post-schooling acting career began in 1971 onstage at the Pittsburgh Playhouse, and he made his film debut in the comedy The Booby Hatch (1976).
