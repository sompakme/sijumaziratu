Moreover, she performed at her hometown of Houston at the March Madness Music Festival AT&T Black Party. Not only was this her first performance of the year, but also her first since her highly publicized case against <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tory Lanez</a> came to a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">guilty end</a> for the Canadian star. While that case is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">still developing</a> on his end, it's clear that Megan is moving on to bigger and better things. For example, her collaboration with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Doja Cat</a>, "Taste Me," is rumored to be released next Friday.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, the "NDA" MC received a lot of love from her day ones while playing for Houston, both in person and on social media. What's more is that her return even prompted some old wounds to heal up, albeit from her opponents. 1501 label boss Carl Crawford <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">praised her for the comeback</a> despite their industry feud and back-and-forths. Last month, the former MLB star issued somewhat of an apology to Megan Thee Stallion, and his latest message about the festival indicated a new album and world tour on the way.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-megan-the-stallion-kills-her-first-performance-after-break>Megan The Stallion Kills Her First Performance After Break</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Unfortunately, me and Megan haven’t talked since 2019,” Crawford remarked. “We been going through what&nbsp;y’all seen online.&nbsp;That’s unfortunate, too, because I never wanted to go have a situation where I was going back and forth with her on the internet. I never had problems with Megan Thee Stallion, but this social media stuff <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">turned it really sour</a>. You take this social media stuff out of it, and we won’t have a problem. You won’t hear me mention Megan Thee Stallion’s name unless it’s a big-time interview."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, the 28-year-old is also making massive moves in the film industry, according to reports online. Moreover, the Safdie Brothers and Adam Sandler reportedly <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">tapped Meg to star in their next film</a>. While it's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">far from her first acting role</a>, the fact that she might link with the Uncut Gems team in a sports memorabilia-based flick is quite exciting. Still, there's nothing quite like seeing the Stallion rock a live show. Check out another clip of her performance below and return to HNHH for the latest on Megan Thee Stallion.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-houston-shows-hometown-love-to-the-hot-girl>Houston Shows Hometown Love To The Hot Girl</h2></span><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaoB3f49mpJ6fkaN6tbTEnmSsrJGhuaq7zWaeoq6VqHq0tM6wZKysn6W9qrrGZp2iqqOperGx0Z%2Bmq6WRo7CmedKipZydXam8s8WMpZinnapiw6a%2Bw6KarQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
