However, when it came to <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ice Spice</a> seemingly shading her last week, the 777 artist seemed unphased. If you missed it, the New York native appeared to agree with fans on Twitter accusing Latto of copying Isis Gaston's signature style. The comments began flying after the former wore a Von Dutch mini skirt and crop top while performing for a huge crowd at <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Wireless Festival.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It's hard to deny the similarities between the "Wheelie" hitmaker's stage ensemble and some of Spice's recent outfits. Still, Latto's fanbase came through with receipts suggesting that it's actually the redhead who's taking a page out of her contemporary's book. Regardless of the drama, 21 Sav's rumoured girlfriend is doing what she can to enjoy her time in Europe for festival season, most recently sharing a photo dump on Instagram of the time she spent exploring London.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-latto-serves-looks-in-london>Latto Serves Looks in London</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This time around Latto took inspiration from another celebrity – kilt-loving lyricist <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>ASAP Rocky</a> – wearing the traditional garment with a sultry twist while exploring England. She didn't hesitate to go full tourist mode, posing with a vibrant red photo booth during her adventures. So complete her kilt OOTD, Latto added a black and red graphic tank top, shades, a purse with gothic spikes on the handle, and combat boots When she wasn't snapping pictures, the 24-year-old found time to drop by Capital Xtra studios for yet another interview.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Latto has obviously always loved using social media to flaunt her countless <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">designer fashions</a>.
