If your child has a naturally curvy and narrow ear canal, it's more likely water can get trapped after any type of water exposure.<h2>How do I protect my baby's ears from water?</h2>To prevent swimmer's ear: Keep ears dry.

"Earwax provides a barrier against water in the external canal in addition to having microbes that prevent infection," said Hai Cao, M.D., a pediatrician in Brooklyn.<h2>Can kids get ear infections from water?</h2>Swimmer's ear (or otitis externa) is common in kids who spend a lot of time in the water.

But you don't have to swim to get swimmer's ear.<h2>How do babies get ear infections?</h2>Ear infections are caused by a bacteria or virus and lead to fluid buildup in the eustachian tubes, which prevents them from draining normally from the middle ear.

Sometimes baths can dry your baby's skin so only use a small amount of soap or baby bath wash.<h2>Why do you dunk baby underwater?</h2>Up until the age of three years old your baby has a reflex that we use for submerging.
