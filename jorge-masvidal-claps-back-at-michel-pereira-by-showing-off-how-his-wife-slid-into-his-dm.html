This row over Masvial sliding into Mrs. Pereira started when Michel mentioned Masvidal in the UFC Vegas 55 post-fight press conference.
Prior to mentioning Masvidal to the press, Michel Pereira won his fight against Santiago Ponzinibio. Pereira was quoted saying “Masival sent my wife a DM on Instagram with an emoji”, “But he didn’t send me anything, I would like to settle this inside the octagon!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This row over Masvial sliding into Mrs. Pereira started when Michel mentioned Masvidal in the UFC Vegas 55 post-fight press conference.</p><p>Prior to mentioning Masvidal to the press, Michel Pereira won his fight against Santiago Ponzinibio. Pereira was quoted saying “Masival sent my wife a DM on Instagram with an emoji”, “But he didn’t send me anything, I would like to settle this inside the octagon!”.</p><p>But Masvidal has now clapped back at Pereira and pointed out his lie to the world. It was in fact Pereira’s wife who dm’d Masvidal first!</p><p>Here is the tweet in question:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>How crazy a world and how far has society fallen that this idiot <a href=# rel=noopener>@UfcPereira</a> would use his wife to hopefully 1 day get a paycheck and create a fake narrative to try and get a fight with me when clearly he sees she slid in my dm? Wishing you guys the best <a href=# rel=noopener>#marriagecounselor</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/M5MwwuH2Le</a></p><p>— BMF.eth (@GamebredFighter) <a href=# rel=noopener>May 23, 2022</a></p><p>Masvidal has accused Pereira of trying to start a feud by creating a false narrative! Gamebred then jokingly said that he wishes the couple the best marriage counselor to sort out their problems! It can also be seen on the screenshot that Gina Amir, Pereira’s wife once mentioned Jorge Masvidal on her IG story back in 2020!</p><p>Has Michel Pereira been lied to by his wife? Or are the couple chasing clout in order to get a massive payday by fighting Masvidal? Either way, a fight of this caliber would do good for both Pereira and Masvidal. As the former is an up and coming star while the latter is on a losing skid and will require a win against a lower-ranked opponent to get his status as the BMF back!</p><p>The story took a surprising turn after Masivdal provided solid evidence of a false narrative by Pereira! Some fans even started questioning Masvidal’s character as to why he would reach out to another man’s wife. But Masvidal’s evidence has probably cleared up his name in the eyes of the UFC and the fans alike!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usspmku2%2BvzqZmo6einLJuucCsraKckaF6pLjAqapmmpGYuG6t02akopuYmrluvMSrnKKqkWKvunnSoaawoZ6cerCyxWafqK9dnba0edainZ5lo6G2pXnIp6uoZZiewG6wzGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
