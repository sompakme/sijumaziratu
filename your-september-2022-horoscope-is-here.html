As droves of school buses reappear and sweaters and school supplies are stocked on shelves, we all have to decide which camp we're aligning with: the crowd that's proudly among the first in line to snag a pumpkin spice latte or the crew that's committed to soaking up every last minute of beach time until the fall equinox and the sun's time in Libra arrives.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether your ideal September is filled with spending extra time al fresco in the blazing sunshine or curating the ultimate fall wardrobe, you likely can't help but pick up on the strong transitional nature of the month. But while transitions tend to go hand-in-hand with the beginning of new chapters, this September's astrology requires a look back before you can fully step into the future.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images/InStyle</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It kicks off with Venus, the planet of love and money, moving into Virgo on September 5, highlighting a thoughtful attention to detail and acts of service as our universal love language until the 29th. And on the 9th, messenger Mercury begins its third <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>retrograde</a> of the year. Until the 23rd, it'll be moving back through Virgo, which can set the stage for revising day-to-day rituals that bolster your health and well-being. This transit can also serve as a reminder that there's quite a bit of magic in what we often shrug off as routine and mundane. And from September 23 to October 2, the planet of communication moves backward through Libra, potentially spurring reflection on partnerships, beauty, and values. Think of it as an opportunity to get your Scales-themed ducks in a row ahead of Libra season. In general, you'll want to prepare to hit the reset button this month as pragmatic, cerebral Virgo and social, balance-seeking Libra take the reins. (Be sure to read your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>rising sign</a> as well as your sun.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aries></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aries</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With the sun moving through your sixth house of wellness and daily routine since August 22, you're in a productive, checklist-making and completing headspace when the month kicks off. When sweet Venus, the planet of relationships, spends time there from September 5 to 29, you'll find you can get even better results when you join forces with friends and loved ones. And it'll be easier to set the stage for social moments on the job and throughout your everyday schedule. Just don't assume you'll be able to plow ahead without encountering roadblocks from time to time, thanks to Mercury retrograde affecting your partnership zone from September 9 to 23 and your daily routine sector from the 23rd to October 2. This period requires slowing down to ensure you're being intentional in your relationships and how you're spending your time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The second half of the month and Libra season highlights potential fresh starts and beginnings in your one-on-one bonds, thanks to a new moon in your partnership zone on September 25. And when your ruler, go-getter Mars in your communication zone, forms a harmonizing trine to taskmaster Saturn in your networking zone, you can put your nose to the grindstone to score a winning result on a team endeavor.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-taurus></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Taurus</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Take heart, Taurus: This month isn't nearly the doozy that last month was, and it won't be nearly as dramatic as next month (which kicks off the second eclipse season of the year with a solar eclipse in your opposite sign, Scorpio, and partnership sector). In other words, it's a chance to do what you love to do most: chill. First off, your ruler, sweet Venus, will be moving through your romance zone from September 5 to 29, which makes this a super pleasure-packed, lighthearted moment. Anticipate more opportunities to be creative and spend time with your sweetheart and loved ones. At basically the same time, though, messenger Mercury will be retrograde from September 9 to October 2, requiring reflection and revision on your wellness regimen as well as your artistic and romantic pursuits. Yes, you could hear from exes, and no, that doesn't mean it's time to go full <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bennifer</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With any retrograde can come not only self-reflection but, quite often, confusion, so if you're not quite sure what direction to go in love or at work or just life right now, the September 10 full moon in your networking sector can help you feel more connecting with friends and colleagues who have your back. And once Libra season kicks off on September 22 and Venus moves through the sign of the Scales from September 29 to October 23, expect a surge of energy in your daily routine and wellness zone. You can more readily practice self-care and bolster vitality through simple everyday rituals, like firing up your favorite meditation app or catching up with a friend.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gemini></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gemini</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With Mars moving through your sign since August 20, your energy is likely soaring come the start of the month. You're buzzing from one trip or social event to the next at a pace that's even wilder than usual. But that momentum you've been building could hit the skids pretty quickly, because your ruler, messenger Mercury, will be moving backward through your self-expression sector and home zone from September 9 to October 2, requiring a major slowdown and refocus on doing your inner work. Sure, it could be more literal, like going back to the drawing board on a home redecorating project or taking walks down memory lane with loved ones. But when your ruler is retrograde, you're urged to turn inward to bolster self-awareness — this time, when it comes to your sense of security and roots.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can expect the mood to lift a bit once the sun shifts into your romance and self-expression zone on September 22. The 25th marks a new moon there, in which you can set a powerful intention that can lead to infusing your life with more joy and fun. And as romantic Venus moves through the same zone from September 29 to October 23, you could enjoy one of the most heartfelt, pleasurable, and creatively stimulating seasons of the year.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cancer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cancer</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since August 22, your focus has been squarely on more social moments, brainstorms, and learning opportunities, thanks to the sun's trip through your communication sector. Venus, the planet of relationships, joins the party from September 5 to 29, which only serves to spike your curiosity and desire to connect with others, so don't be surprised if you end up making new friends or coming up with exciting collaborative ideas during this period. Still, messenger Mercury moves backward through your home zone from September 9 to 23, and tending to loose ends related to family relationships and possibly old emotional wounds might need to take precedence over spending time with friends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though you tend to be perfectly happy focusing on family and your home life, restlessness could strike around September 10, when your ruler, the moon, is full in your adventure zone whips up your desire to get out of your comfort zone. The remedy: taking a leap of faith that's informed by what your gut is saying, versus your head. And no matter how this particularly emotional Mercury retrograde has gone for you, you'll get a chance to look toward the future around September 25, when the moon is new in your home sector. Envision moving in with a significant other, research ways to upgrade to a bigger living space, or make another move that boosts your sense of inner peace and security.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-leo></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Leo</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your ruler, the self-assured sun, has been moving through your money sector since August 22, supporting your ability to bring in more cash. Relationship-ruler Venus will be there from September 5 to 29, which can serve to make you even more charismatic and successful. Coming off of your own season, it's possible you've been able to pitch a passion project or make strides on a long-term personal goal, which probably feels pretty amazing — and is undoubtedly well-deserved. Just know that you might need to slow down before you can fully move the ball forward, thanks to messenger Mercury's retrograde in your communication zone from September 9 to 23 and then money zone from the 23rd to October 2. While you tend to be so action-oriented and ambitious that delays drive you up the wall, this three-week chill-out period could actually lead to being more intentional with how you're exerting your energy, making for an even more rewarding result in the long-haul.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And once the confident sun moves through your communication sector from September 22 to October 23, you'll be particularly compelled to connect with others, capitalize on learning opportunities, and fill up your schedule with intellectually stimulating commitments. Around the 25th, when the new moon falls there, consider getting clear on a social goal you might like to achieve — like throwing a party or making more friends at your Pilates class.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-virgo></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Virgo</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since August 22, the sun has been shining in your sign, bolstering your confidence and setting the stage for you to further your most ambitious aspirations. Your self-image has gotten a boost, and your relationships, in turn, should already be benefiting from this elevated mind-body vitality. But when Venus, the planet of love and beauty, moves through your sign from September 5 to 29, the whole world speaks your love language. This can make for a super-creative, romantic period in which you can readily channel fellow Virgo Queen Bey and feel extra "cozy" in your skin. Just know that pushing hard for your plans to take flight ASAP and being in a super future-minded headspace could backfire with your ruler, messenger Mercury, retrograde in your money zone from September 9 to 23 and in your sign from the 23rd to October 2.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead of seeing this retrograde period as a total pain, reframe it as a productive moment in which you can lean into your innate ability to reflect, revise, and edit whatever's no longer supporting your sense of self-worth and identity. You'll also do well to circle September 20, as Venus in your sign will form a harmonizing trine to revolutionary Uranus in your adventure zone, spurring eye-opening, innovative ideas and out-of-the-box thinking, especially when it comes to creative projects or your relationships (romantic or platonic).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With the sun moving through your spirituality sector since August 22, it can kind of feel like you're backstage waiting to walk under the bright spotlights. Every year, this period can be restful, restorative, and a bit sleepy. Venus, your ruler, is in the same zone from September 5 to 29, which could have you feeling a bit more private — even secretive — when it comes to what's in your heart. And given that you're such a people person, this quiet vibe could feel a little out of character to you. But it's something you'll want to embrace as best you can, especially because messenger Mercury will be retrograde in your sign from September 9 to 23 and then in your spirituality and dreams sector from the 23rd to October 2. Although this might not be the most off-the-charts social moment of the year for you, it does give you a chance to meditate on how you're getting after your aspirations and potentially rework any strategy that's not translating to results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once the sun moves through your sign from September 22 to October 23, you'll enjoy a surge of confidence that supports your ability to turn any passionate vision into a reality. Even though Mercury is retrograde, you could gain quite a bit of clarity on the path ahead. Around September 25, be sure to take advantage of your annual new moon by setting a powerful intention and taking even one significant step toward your ideal future.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-scorpio></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Scorpio</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sun in your networking zone since August 22 has thrown your attention toward group efforts, socializing with friends and colleagues, and possibly networking even more intently than usual. And when Venus, the planet of relationships, is there from September 5 to 29, you'll be even more of a force to be reckoned with in the communities and teams that you align yourself with. Just know that if it feels like your progress on a particular collaborative effort is stalled, it's not you — it's Mercury, which kicks off its third retrograde of the year in your spirituality zone on September 9. You'll be pulled into a super-self-reflective, perhaps even broody headspace, dreams could be more vivid and bring up memories you thought you'd swept under the rug, and you might feel like though you know which seeds you'd like to plant to step into the next chapter, you need more clarity before you can even do that. Yep, this limbo phase — which lasts until October 2 — can be frustrating, but sitting in it and accepting it for what it is serves you better than fighting it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Around September 10, the full moon lights up your romance and self-expression zone, which can inspire you to hit pause on work and embrace a spontaneous, joyful moment with loved ones or your significant other. You're compelled to listen to and follow your heart more than anything now. And on September 28, your ruler, go-getter Mars in your emotional bonds sector harmonizes with taskmaster Saturn in your home zone, and you'll be even more willing than usual to put in the work to take an intimate relationship to the next level.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sagittarius></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sagittarius</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the sun has been moving through your career zone since August 22, you've had the chance to boldly take the reins on key projects on the job, impress higher-ups, and, in general, go hard pursuing your big picture professional aspirations. This time of year can see you really earning a round of applause for putting your nose to the grindstone — and, OK, being a fiery, buoyant, and often unfiltered force. Venus moves through the same zone from September 5 to 29, amplifying your charm. But communicator Mercury's retrograde in your networking zone from September 9 to 23 could throw a wrench in collaborative projects that have just started to take off — or that you're hoping to launch right now. Instead of hitting the gas, you're urged to rethink your approach and be even more of a team player, using your natural leadership abilities to double-check that everyone involved has had their say and felt heard.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mercury then moves backward through your career zone from September 23 to October 2, and you'll do well to examine how you're getting after your long-term goals and cultivating your public image. Once the sun is in your friendship zone from September 22 to October 23, the vibe of the moment gets a lot more social and in line with your M.O. You'll feel more connected, which can cause your optimism to soar.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-capricorn></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Capricorn</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You're usually happy enough to stick to the tried-and-true, everyday routine — as long as you're seeing returns on your energetic investment, of course. But Virgo season can ratchet up your desire to get out of your comfort zone, learn, and grow. You might be itching to travel, learn a new language, work with a mentor or mentor someone more junior to you, or get into deep, philosophical conversations with colleagues. Once Venus moves through this same sector from September 5 to 23, you'll find connecting with people outside of your usual friend group comes more naturally, as well. But be prepared for a bit of work stress that could pop up as a result of messenger Mercury's retrograde in your career sector from September 9 to 23. Projects you thought you had completed might require revision, or that raise or promotion you assumed you had in the bag could be up in the air.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_82-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Do your best not to jump to conclusions, because everything is in flux now, and once the planet of communication moves forward on October 2, you'll find clarity is easier to come by. In the meantime, consider broadening your horizons however you can, because with the confident sun moving through your higher learning sector from September 22 to October 23, anything you can do to break free of the mundane benefits you intellectually and spiritually.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the sun moves through your emotional bonds sector during Virgo season, you're pulled into some pretty heavy territory as you're contending with issues related to your sex life, intimate relationships, and joint resources. And that'll remain the case until September 22 — especially as Venus, the planet of relationships, moves through this zone, too, from September 5 to 29. At the same time, it's possible you've been daydreaming — or even acting definitely — on what you want to achieve in the months ahead, making plans for future long-distance trips or signing up for classes that would allow you to advance your education, possibly even your career. While messenger Mercury moves backward through your adventure and higher learning zone from September 9 to 23, you'll want to research all of these plans further and perhaps hold off on making any bold moves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the planet of communication moves backward through your intimacy and transformation sector from September 23 to October 2, you'll want to be quite intentional when voicing your needs within your closest relationships. Now's your chance to state what makes you comfortable and what's actually undermining your sense of security. And even though Mercury will still be retrograde at the time, the new moon on September 25 marks a thrilling moment in which you can dream up how to best level up — and achieve — a long-held personal goal.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pisces></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_92-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pisces</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_93-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_94-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The confident sun has been moving through your partnership sector since August 22, and when romantic Venus joins the party on September 5, you'll very much be in the thick of your annual focus on one-on-one bonds. Know that this season isn't just about zeroing in on your significant other, dear friend, or loved one's needs. It's also about reflecting on how you can best show up for yourself within these relationships. And you'll also need to consider reciprocity as well. Once the planet of communication, Mercury, moves backward through your intimacy sector from September 9 to 23, you're nudged to reflect on the amount of energy you're putting into your closest bonds.
