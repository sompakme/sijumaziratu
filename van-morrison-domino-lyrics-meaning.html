Perhaps this song is about playing love games, in light of the references to Romeo and “never hear[ing] from him.” Most of us are aware that Romeo references a "a lover, passionate admirer, seducer of women."</p><p>“And if you never hear from him, that just means he didn’t call,” supports the idea that writer is addressing the fact that his love interest has interest in another man. The fact that the writer says “roll me over, Romeo,” suggests that the other man is the Romeo.</p><p>So, if the other man is the Romeo, and the writer says, “I think it’s time for a change,” this could mean that the writer is contemplating backing off in the relationship with his love interest, in light of her involvement of Romeo.</p><p>Now, why the writer would say the following, I’m unsure:</p><p>You may get disgusted, and think I’m strange<br>In that case I’ll go underground<br>Get some heavy rest<br>Never have to worry<br>About what is worst and what is best</p><p>I don’t know why the writer’s potential change would disgust the love interest. I could see a love interest being disappointed or angry. But disgusted sounds like “discuss it,” from a previous line, and this may be the writer’s best effort at lyrically conveying the love interest’s potential disappointment or anger over the proposed change.</p><p>As far as,<br>In that case I’ll go underground<br>Get some heavy rest<br>Never have to worry<br>About what is worst and what is best</p><p>I think the writer means that, if the love interest chooses to continue with Romeo, in light of the writer’s proposed change, the writer will retreat, disconnect from, and ignore the love interest and possibly self medicate, either literally or figuratively.</p><p>If the lover continues with Romeo, the writer may want to rid his lover from his mind. The writer would want to avoid thinking about whether it’s better to stay with the lover, and put up with the lack of exclusivity, or retreat.</p><p>Regarding</p><p>Oh oh domino<br>Roll me over romeo</p><p>The writer may be saying, oh, the games of love! The writer may be exasperated over such games. The writer seems to say, go ahead, Romeo, and continue to ruin my otherwise good situation. The writer seems to feel defeated.</p><p>There’s no need for argument<br>There’s no argument at all<br>And if you never hear from him<br>That just means he didn’t call<br>Or vice versa<br>That depends on where ever you’re at<br>And if you never hear from me<br>That just means I would rather not</p><p>The writer seems to say that he doesn’t want to argue or negotiate. He seems firm. He is repeating the idea behind “don’t want to discuss it.”</p><p>He also suggests the possibility that the relationship between his lover and Romeo may fail. Romeo may only want a fling with the writer’s lover and may stop calling at any time. The lover may not be willing to pursue her Romeo. The writer is reminding his lover that she could lose twice, if she continues with Romeo.</p><p>That depends on where ever you’re at</p><p>I struggle to find the meaning to this. Maybe the writer is merely saying the choice is up to you, my love. The outcome depends on your choice, the writer seems to say.</p><p>And if you never hear from me<br>That just means I would rather not</p><p>The writer seems to say, no pressure, my love. But the writer seems to imply that, if the choice is to keep the status quo, the writer will retreat.</p><p>This is my first time to write or post an interpretation. The full text of the lyrics, taken from another website, follows:</p><p>Don’t want to discuss it<br>I think it’s time for a change<br>You may get disgusted<br>And think I’m strange<br>In that case I’ll go underground<br>Get some heavy rest<br>Never have to worry<br>About what is worst and what is best</p><p>Oh oh domino<br>Roll me over romeo<br>There you go<br>Lord have mercy<br>I said oh oh domino<br>Roll me over romeo<br>There you go<br>Say it again<br>I said oh oh domino<br>I said oh oh domino</p><p>There’s no need for argument<br>There’s no argument at all<br>And if you never hear from him<br>That just means he didn’t call<br>Or vice versa<br>That depends on where ever you’re at<br>And if you never hear from me<br>That just means I would rather not</p><p>I said oh oh domino<br>Roll me over romeo<br>There you go<br>Lord have mercy<br>I said oh oh domino<br>Roll me over romeo<br>There you go<br>Say it again<br>Oh oh domino<br>I said oh oh domino.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZq%2BZnmK6sL7Roqqopl%2BZvK61zag%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
