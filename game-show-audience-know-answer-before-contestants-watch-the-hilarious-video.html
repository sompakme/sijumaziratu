The audience were quick to realise that the name they were trying to guess was 'Quasimodo', and broke down in laughter when the contestants picked the wrong letters. Laughing at the audience's disappointed reaction when Troy guessed the letter 'P', he joked: "It's good that you know it!" After Lyndsey then took her turn, guessing the wrong letter yet again, an amused Mel said: "Troy, I beg of you, please. Please," before Troy guessed wrong once more, suggesting a 'C'. Troy joked: "This is stressing me out," before Mel pointed to herself and the audience, replying: "It's stressing us out as well Troy!"</p><p id=ea8Ca2lV5Iod><a class=hm-link href=#>READ:&nbsp;Celebrate National Cream Tea Day with this GBBO winner's lemon and caraway scones recipe</a></p><p id=eOG3pb2Z2YBW><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/386baef95a23-mel-and-sue-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=evcZOCV_vMLT data-wc=9><strong>Mel and Sue will be hosting&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e8fjCaHhRTC2 data-wc=112>Troy finally guesses a 'U', then realised what the word was to applause. BBC Two tweeted the video, writing: "This is amazing. When everyone knows the answer... except you." Fans were quick to discuss the video, with one writing: "Seriously people," while another deadpanned: "They didn't have a hunch what it was?" Although Mel is currently hosting she recently confirmed that she will&nbsp;be joining up with her co-presenter <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Sue Perkins to co-host a reboot of The Generation Game. </a></strong>The pair released a statement on Monday which read: "It's a cuddly toy, it's a toaster, it's a circular power saw, no it's MEL & SUE DOING THE GENERATION GAME!
