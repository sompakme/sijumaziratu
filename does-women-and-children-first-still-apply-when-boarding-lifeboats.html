Per a paper on the subject available through <a href=#>Columbia University</a>,&nbsp;William Herndon, the captain of the S.S. Central America, reportedly told his men to "save the women and children," after the ship became caught in a hurricane. The crew understood it meant that they (the men) would likely die; the majority of them did.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>But here's the thing: "Women and children first" was never an actual maritime law, according to another 2006 academic paper published by <a href=#>The Journal of the Social History Society</a>. Rather, the concept was simply a moral code that sailors and passengers lived by. That code was sacrosanct, too. In the case of the <a href=#>sinking of the Titanic</a> in 1912, many of the men who managed to sneak, bully, luck, or jump their way onto a lifeboat were later considered cowards. One tragic example, according to <a href=#>The A.V. Club</a>, was the story of a male Japanese survivor named Masabumi Hosono, who was one of the last two people allowed to board lifeboat 10. Unfortunately, he was later considered a coward by the public at large and eventually died by suicide due to the fallout.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEknFtcWtfmbymv4ywpqadnmKur7CMnJ%2BipJSnsq95xaKprKxdqMGquMtmmKmonK56uLTEp2Sbp5Gnsaq6xmajop6Vl7yiwNJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
