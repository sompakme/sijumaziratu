The story of Brian and Melinda's relationship began in 1986, when they first met as she sold him a Cadillac. Their on-and-off relationship, which started in 1989, rekindled in 1992 in Los Angeles, leading to their marriage three years later. In a 1998 interview with People, Brian described Melinda as 'a partner who's also a best friend', a sentiment he had never experienced before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7299353c1d09-arrives-wife-melinda-ledbetter-2nd-2555409.jpg><p id=esF8L9uOipG data-wc=73>Melinda opened up about Brian's challenges in dealing with 'the world's insanity', while paradoxically calling him 'probably the most sane person' she knew. Their love story and Brian's struggles, including his battles with mental illness and his controversial relationship with his late therapist and legal guardian Dr. Eugene Landy, were captured in the 2014 biopic Love & Mercy. Paul Dano and John Cusack portrayed Brian, while Elizabeth Banks played Melinda in the film.</p><p id=eZLJyWDhvoT data-wc=38>Melinda played a crucial role in helping Brian distance himself from Dr. Landy, who was barred from any contact with Brian in 1992 following a lawsuit from Wilson's family, accusing Landy of having 'undue influence' over the musician.&nbsp;</p><p id=eWaw6DYoEHv data-wc=34>Reflecting on this period, Melinda said in a 2004 Larry King interview that initially, Landy did help Brian with his physical health, but over time, the relationship turned controlling, effectively making Brian a prisoner.</p><p id=eljVpiwtGYDS data-wc=60>In a 1998 conversation with The Chicago Tribune, Melinda spoke about Brian rebuilding his life post-Landy and his troubled upbringing. She observed that Brian's growth in love and family marked a significant shift from his past, filled with abuse and neglect. She wondered how different his music might have been had he experienced a supportive, loving family from the beginning.</p><p id=eEdWLSUHSktP data-wc=46>In 2015, speaking to ABC News about the film adaptation of their story, Melinda admitted the challenge of watching their life portrayed on screen. Recalling their experience watching Love & Mercy, she shared Brian's reaction, indicating that reality had been much harsher than its cinematic depiction.</p><p id=e5h3XKcglxfwp data-wc=21>Before her foray into auto sales, Melinda was a native of Whittier, California, and had a 16-year career as a model.</p><p id=e8Z_HgxtNwN5 data-wc=32><strong></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
