He is widely known for his genuine passion for professional wrestling, and fans appreciate that he is primarily in charge of the decisions being made within AEW. In fact, he was recently criticized for being a huge mark.</p><p>The AEW President is the primary booker for the company and this has led to mixed results so far, over the course of four years. This is largely due to the fact that many people feel he is booking storylines and matches like a fan and not as a proper booker.</p><p>Over the past few years, AEW has risen to become one of the most popular wrestling promotions. However, former WWE and WCW star Konnan has publicly expressed his dissatisfaction with Tony Khan’s leadership and booking approach.</p><p>While speaking on the most recent episode of <a href=#>K100 w/ Konnan & Disco</a>, WCW veteran Konnan made it clear that he is not a fan of how Tony Khan’s booking. He then ripped Tony Khan for being a major hardcore mark.</p><p>“He obviously wants to make money. I mean, that’s what he’s all about. If he doesn’t make money, the network’s going to cut him off or his dad may say, ‘f*ck this,’ you know what I’m saying?”</p><p>“[Khan’s] obviously trying to make money. His problem is [that] he’s a mega hardcore mark, which there’s a niche for that. He probably thinks there’s more people than there actually [is] and he caters to them and nobody else. I think that’s a huge problem.”</p><p>Since December, tensions between Konnan and Tony Khan have reportedly escalated due to a miscommunication regarding the competitors in the AAA Tag Team Championship match at “Night of Champions.” Konnan apparently attempted to resolve the issue during an “AEW Dark” taping in Orlando last week, but it remains unclear how successful the conversation was.</p><p><strong>What is your take on this story?
