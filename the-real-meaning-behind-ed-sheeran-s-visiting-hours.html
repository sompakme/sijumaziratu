Although Sheeran hasn't confirmed, the "she" he's referring to is most likely <a href=#>his daughter</a>, who was <a href=#>born in August 2020</a>.&nbsp;As she was born during the pandemic, and Sheeran and Gudinski live on opposite sides of the world, it's likely they didn't have a chance to meet before the promoter died.</p><p dir=ltr>Sheeran also included his own fears, as well as Gudinski's advice: "Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear? / I'd tell you that I'm scared of turning out a failure / He'd say, 'Remember that the answer's in the love that we create.'"</p><p dir=ltr>Sheeran broke down soon after that line, but he managed to finish the touching tribute with this powerful promise. "And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart / And everyone I love will know exactly who you are / 'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again / So much has changed since you've been away."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG5lboV3e9OhnGaqlZa5brnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZp2UYsCpscSrmKerXau2tLXToqWgZZikwrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
