Maybe it was my life stage before marriage and baby, but I was definitely having more fun—and obsessed with achieving the iciest hue possible.&nbsp;However, the process of transitioning dark hair to a much lighter tone is no joke—and one best left up to the professionals.</p><p>“Don’t be impulsive when it comes to being blonde,” cautions celebrity hairstylist, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.barbdoeshair.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Barb Thompson</a>. “I tell most clients to give me at least three appointments to get the inspiration for blonde that they have. It’s a marathon not a sprint.” Lifting your natural color to a lighter tone can be damaging (bleach is involved), so it's important to take the coloring process slow.</p><p>There are a handful of tips to keep in mind before, during, and after taking your dark hair blonde to ensure a healthy (and vibrant) outcome. Here, top stylists are sharing their tips and tricks.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-does-dyeing-brown-hair-blonde-cause-damage><span>Does Dyeing Brown Hair Blonde Cause Damage?</span></h2><p>Without going too deep into the chemistry of hair color, Creative Director of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/avedaarts/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Aveda Arts & Sciences Institutes</u></a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://neill.com/class/tatum-neill/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Tatum Neill </a>reminds us that “blonding your hair is a process of opening up the cuticle and removing elements of your hair until it gets to your desired level of yellow tone, and often adding a color to neutralize the tone that remains." If that sounds like that is a lot of stress on your hair, it's because it is.</p><p>When the hair is damaged to begin with, dyeing it becomes that much more troublesome. "Coloring damaged hair is about much more than just split ends or straw-like strands, it can affect the color itself and how it is absorbed in the hair," says celebrity hairstylist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://mechesalonla.com/meet-the-team/tracey-cunningham/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Tracey Cunningham</a>. As a rule of thumb, wait until your hair is healthy to begin a blonde transformation. Otherwise, you can end up with irreparable damage.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-to-prevent-color-damage><span>How to Prevent Color Damage</span></h2><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-take-it-slow><span>Take It Slow</span></h3><p>In order to prevent damage, you'll want to make the transition over the course of a few coloring sessions. How long it takes depends heavily on your current hair color. Founder and creative director of <u>NYC The Team</u>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.nyctheteam.com/stylists referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Michelle Hong</a> explains that those with previous hair colors like dark brown or red might have trouble achieving their ideal blonde in just one session. Individuals with fine hair will also have to be more cautious.</p><p>“Ask your colorist what is realistic about the first session with your current hair and how many appointments are needed to achieve what you want,” Hong adds. Sometimes, it can take over a year to achieve the level of lift desired while maintaining hair health.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

It can be high maintenance. Just remember: The more frequently you add bleach to your hair, the more damage you risk.</p><p>“Ask your colorist what the upkeep is. When doing balayage highlights, maintenance can be every two to three&nbsp;months versus a platinum blonde shade where the maintenance may be four to six weeks," Hong says. "Inquire about any necessary glosses or toners in between appointments&nbsp;to keep your new hair color true to tone and healthy.” These also add in a hydration boost to prevent your ends from drying out and breaking.</p><p>Neill adds that touch ups really depend on how much lighter you go in comparison to your natural hue. “If you choose a lived in blonde look, then you can probably get away with quarterly maintenance. If your look is more of a transformational blonde, you may want to go back to the salon every six to eight weeks.”</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-incorporate-hair-strengthening-products><span>Incorporate Hair Strengthening Products</span></h3><p>How you treat your hair post-bleach has a big impact on your damage—or lack thereof. “Hair coloring is all about maintenance. It does take work, but make sure to incorporate a regimen so your locks look the best. Blondes can still be healthy and shiny as long as there is TLC,” notes Hong.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, she’s a fan of color-safe shampoos and deep conditioning masks. “[Overall] be gentle with your hair when brushing or detangling and always use a heat protector and aftercare products to keep your hair nourished and moisturized. Plan out a hair care routine and treat it like your skin care routine to keep your hair looking the best it can.”</p><a href=# data-model-name="Foundation Shampoo" data-url=https://rozhair.com/products/foundation-shampoo%20 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qLxPd3uftZi2YMFfnkUcGU-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Foundation Shampoo</p><p>Dubbed as “the only shampoo you’ll ever need,” this clean, coconut-based cleanser helps remove product build-up and keep hair feeling soft.&nbsp;</p><a href=# data-model-name="Milbon Moisture Replenishing Treatment Hair Conditioner" data-url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Milbon-Moisture-Replenishing-Treatment-Hair-Conditioner/1797798097?
