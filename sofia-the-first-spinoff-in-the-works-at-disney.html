Together, we have produced three meaningful, diverse shows, and I am looking forward to broadening the scope of our collaboration while also championing new voices. It’s particularly thrilling to return to the enchanted world of Sofia the First, where it all began 10 years ago, and create a follow-up series that is just as magical.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The possible Sofia spinoff would be set at Royal Prep Academy, a school for princes and princesses in the kingdom of Enchancia that Sofia and her step-siblings James and Amber attended. The news comes just before the 10th anniversary of Sofia the First’s debut on Disney Junior on Nov. 18, 2012.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">It’s one of two projects Gerber and his Electric Emu company have in the works at Disney Branded TV; the other, created by Kris Wimberly (Elena of Avalor, Firebuds) follows a time-traveling treasure hunter who recovers lost family heirlooms. Gerber will executive produce the latter along with Wimberly.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Sofia the First was a breakout success for Disney Junior, running for four seasons and more than 100 episodes.
