However, it ultimately paid off as many fans have called this his best work yet. Now, Yachty is going to be taking to the main stage of various festivals this year. He is expected to perform this new album, and the live show is likely going to be a whole lot of fun. Needless to say, Yachty is winning at life.</p><p>Now, he is going to be getting a new honor that <a href=# rel>many rappers before him have received</a>. Yes, that is right, Lil Yachty is going to be a <a href=# rel>playable character in NBA 2K23</a>. This is something that has certainly been done before. The likes of <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Durk</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>J. Cole</a> have also gotten their own characters. Furthermore, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Wayne</a> was even bestowed this honor. That is not to say this is not a special thing to have happened to the artist. Overall, it is a testament to Yachty's fame.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-yachty-x-nba-2k>Lil Yachty x NBA 2K</h2></span><p>In the images above, you can see Yachty's character model through MyTeam. If you want to play as him, you will have to beat his Spotlight Challenge which will subsequently earn you his card. As for the look of his character, he has his signature beads in his braids. Moreover, it seems as though he wearing a pair of <a href=# class=text-word rel="nofollow noopener">Air Jordan</a> 1s. He even has the number 21 for good measure. Whether or not people will gravitate toward his character model, remains to be seen. After all, there are a ton of rappers to choose from within the game at this point.</p><p>Hopefully, we continue to see artists like Lil Yachty in the game. In a few months' time, NBA 2K24 will be dropping, and we can only imagine what some of the plans are for that release. Let us know if you will be playing as Yachty in the game, in the comments below.
