Cage stars opposite&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_nicholas-hoult data-tag=nicholas-hoult>Nicholas Hoult</a>, who plays Dracula’s tortured assistant as he seeks a life outside of serving the count, and said he was drawn to the dual tones of the film.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“With this Dracula, I was trying to fuse that which is scary and humorous even at the same time in the line delivery,” he said on Tuesday. “It was just how can you be creepy and funny at the same time, that was the challenge.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As Cage himself noted, “Dracula is a character that’s been done many times, it’s been done well a few times.” He said the performances of Christopher Lee, Bela Lugosi, Frank Langella and Gary Oldman served as a starting point, but his father, August Coppola, was the biggest influence on his portrayal.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“He always spoke with distinction, he was always very elegant and eloquent, he was always the smartest man in every room he walked in and he knew, and he made sure we knew,” Cage explained. “I think Dracula, being around for so many years, would have some of that aura.” He also cited Anne Bancroft’s performance in The Graduate as another inspiration, who he thought was “very seductive and Dracula-esque. So I was looking at her manner of speaking, kind of mid-Atlantic vocalization that both my father and Anne Bancroft had.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As for Hoult, Renfield served as a reunion with Cage after the two worked together on 2005’s The Weather Man, when the younger actor was just 14.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I think getting to work with him again as an adult gave me a true appreciation of what a master he is of the craft, how much he’s given to the cinematic world over the years, all of the iconic performances he’s given, and I think this is another one,” Hoult told THR, adding that when he read the script, “I was like, ‘Oh, this feels very different. It’s a swing, but if it works then I think we have a fun movie.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">McKay said he knew Cage was right to play the iconic vampire because “the way the script was written, he’s supposed to be the rock ‘n’ roll Dracula, so what better person to embody rock ‘n’ roll Dracula than Nicolas Cage? He can wear rings, he can wear the outfits, he looks amazing, and he’s got the right attitude.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The director remembered that that he was “almost in tears” the first time he saw Cage fully in costume: “It was like OK, this movie is going to work.” Co-star Ben Schwartz also said Cage was right for the role “because I think he’s unpredictable, I think he brings such uniqueness to roles, you kind of don’t know what he’s going to do,” noting that he brings 110 percent to every scene.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“So he’s in there, and when he’s Dracula, he’s so in the zone, and he gets himself pumped up and it’s just like you’re acting with Dracula,” Schwartz said. “And the best part is when they say ‘Cut,’ you’re just standing next to Dracula hanging out afterwards being like, ‘So I loved Adaptation.’ So it’s very fun.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Renfield hits theaters April 14.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Neha Joy contributed to this story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofK%2B1wqijmqtdmK6osYydoKylmajApr%2BMq5ypp6KpwG7DxKerZqWVqbWwsIydqZqbpaGubr7Ep52inZyZenJ%2Bkm5qb2tiZoFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
