And their social media captions only gave the tabloids more ammunition.</p><p lang=en-us paraid=43517977 paraeid={6ee50f81-dc16-4060-ae3a-a6872a316b17}{9}>The "God's Plan" hitmaker was the first to upload the backstage snap on an Instagram&nbsp;Story that July alongside the words, "Just met my rightful wife," later adding, "If my girl see ya'll backstage being thirsty it's gonna get smokey." For her part, Sexyy Red soon treated her own <a href=#>Instagram</a> followers to the same photo with the caption, "I'm yo favorite rapper favorite rapper." That wasn't the only evidence that the pair had gotten close, however, since the "Pound Town" star was later tapped up to support Drake and 21 Savage on their "It's All a Blur Tour."</p><p lang=en-us paraid=1293455130 paraeid={656271f5-4e54-4ce7-abde-a3155d64c86f}{24}>In another picture uploaded to Sexyy Red's <a href=#>Instagram</a> account the following month, the pair could once again be seen embracing. This time around, it was accompanied by the star hinting to her followers at some kind of connection. Meanwhile, at the Rolling Loud Festival in July, Sexyy Red revealed (via <a href=#>Daily Loud</a>) that they've been spending time in the studio, too — so perhaps it's merely all platonic between these two. "We got a song coming out," she explained. "I mean, we supposed to be. I did some lil s*** on his song, he sent me a beat, and I had rapped for him or whatever. He was f***in' with it, so we gon' see if he drop that b****."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtpbH11g46upa2nnJl6tb7UrZ9mq5Wtxrp50Z6baA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
