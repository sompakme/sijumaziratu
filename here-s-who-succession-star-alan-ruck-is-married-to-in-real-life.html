We're talking Brad Pitt in "World War Z," Sean Penn in "Gangster Squad," and Reese Witherspoon in "Devil's Knot." And, her TV resume is just as impressive. From "The Catch" to "Hanna," she's been a lead in several big series — and her part in "The Killing" even saw her nominated for a Golden Globe and an Emmy, among others.&nbsp;</p><p>That the majority of her past work is pretty serious — and oftentimes dark — isn't lost on Enos.&nbsp;In fact, speaking to <a href=#>USA Today</a>, she joked that she couldn't watch many of her past projects with her kids. "My daughter wants to sit and watch the things that I've done with me, and she can't!" she shared. It's for precisely that reason that her role on AMC's <a href=#>"Lucky Hank"</a> was a welcome change from that. "I was really holding out for something like this, that walks that incredible line between real life and the absurdity and comedy of life," she explained.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of that holding out, she also joked that she would have been willing to go back to more serious roles if the need had arisen. "I would go to Alan [Ruck] and say, 'I promise I won't let us starve," she shared.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampoa356gI6moKudmaG5pnnEp6asZaOqsKSx0qygqKZdlrmiuoyrrJyjXay2p7GO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
