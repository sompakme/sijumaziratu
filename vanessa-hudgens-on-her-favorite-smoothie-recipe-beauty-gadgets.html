And just incorporating some planty goodness into my breakfast is the perfect, easy way to kickstart my day. I think smoothies are a very easy, fun way to incorporate that into breakfast, and it’s really fun and easy.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silk_Vanessa_Smoothie-PUBLICITY-EMBED-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The 35-year-old star (alongside Peloton instructor Robin Arzón and NFL pro-turned-commentator LaVar Arrington) is encouraging people to add more plants to their meals by joining Silk’s Feel Planty Good Challenge. Those who participate can enter to win a lifetime’s supply of free breakfast from Silk, and six more winners will get free breakfast for a year.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Of Silk’s non-dairy drinks, Hudgens notes, “this also has no added sugar, which is huge. And there’s 50 percent more calcium than milk, and there’s a ton of vitamins and minerals and protein, so it’s just a kind of no-brainer. And it’s so easy too. Yeah, you can make smoothies, but then you can also throw it into your coffee or into your cereal. There’s so many different options and ways that you can use it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Hudgens, who <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>recently wed</a> pro baseball player Cole Tucker in Tulum, Mexico, shared more about her “Beige Not Boring” smoothie, her dream Coachella lineup, her upcoming Hollywood projects and the skincare essential that’s a mainstay in her shower.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>What’s your smoothie style? Are you an Erewhon type with everything in it but the kitchen sink? Or do you keep it simple?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I feel like I normally just do the exact same thing, but with the repetition, I feel like it can get a little boring, and that’s what I’m trying to not do this year! So I really ventured out and tried new things and gotten a little more adventurous with my smoothies. The smoothie that I actually created for this challenge is not your typical smoothie. It’s got some interesting ingredients in it, but it’s actually really delicious. So I’m excited for everyone to give it a try and let me know what they think.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">It’s called Beige Not Boring — it has peanut butter and chocolate, but also chickpeas. I wanted to incorporate something that is from my [Filipino] heritage, so I pulled from the chickpeas and it’s really delicious and nutrient-rich. And with the Silk almond milk, it’s got 50 percent more calcium than milk and protein and vitamins. So I’m really jump-starting my day right.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Are the chickpeas a Filipino ingredient? I’m also Filipino, but my family doesn’t use them often.</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Yeah! At least in my household there was. There’s a few great Filipino dishes that have chickpeas.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>What’s your go-to blender right now for making smoothies?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I’ve got my <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Vitamix</a> that I feel like has been the tried and true companion for smoothie-making, but I also have my <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Nutribullet</a> on hand.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>What does your daily routine look like these days?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Well, I definitely start my morning off with a plant-forward breakfast, and then getting some sort of active movement in, whether that’s a yoga class or a hike or indoor cycling or Pilates. It’s just a rotation between all of those. Those are the things that I love doing. I do them with friends, I feel like it’s always nice to have an accountability partner. Then do a little work at home on one of my companies. If there’s anything that needs to be focused on needs addressing, I’ll handle that then. And then catch up with friends. I feel like I spend a good amount of time with my friends and family and then dinner and then a bath because I’m a big bath person!</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>What projects do you have coming down the pipeline that you’re excited about?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">We have still yet to finish Bad Boys we had a bit more filming to do on location before the strike happened, so that’ll be coming up pretty soon. But that’s always a fun franchise to be a part of. And I did a movie that I love called The French Girl with Zach Braff. It’s a great comedy and I get to play kind of a villain, but a really cute one! It’s fun to mix it up.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>We’re big fans of your brand, Know Beauty’s face masks. What’s coming down the pipeline there?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">We actually just launched our water purification line and I’m really excited and legitimately it use every single day. Being in LA, I didn’t realize how many toxins were actually in the water. And you can actually go [to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Environmental Working Group’s website</a>] and type in your ZIP code and it’ll tell you <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/drinking-water-data-and-reports>what’s in the water</a> and it’s really disturbing. We spend so much money on skincare products and hair products and all these things, but we’re not actually fixing the root of the problem, which is the water that we’re using. So I developed this water filtration system. It’s a shower head that is really easy to use and install, and it’s got some added goodness in there with hyaluronic acid and vitamin C just filtering out your water so that you’re actually getting clean water.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">And it feels so luxurious, I love taking everyday life things and making it a luxurious moment for yourself, you step into the shower and it smells good, and the water pressure feels amazing with the shower head and you’re just getting good clean water and it’s helped my skin genuinely.</p><a href=# class="c-lazy-image__link lrv-a-unstyle-link" rel=nofollow><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Know-Beauty-White-Showerhead-EMBED2024.png alt="Know Beauty White Filtered Showerhead" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>Know Beauty<h3 id=c-title-662645f765a813.64819382 class="c-title product-title lrv-u-font-family-body lrv-u-font-weight-normal lrv-u-font-size-38@tablet lrv-u-font-size-32 u-line-height-35 lrv-u-margin-b-050 lrv-a-unstyle-inner-links">Know Beauty Handheld Showerhead</h3><p><span class="c-span current-price u-font-family-accent-fancy lrv-u-font-size-24 lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-line-height-small">$45</span><span class="c-span original-price lrv-u-text-decoration-line-through lrv-u-font-size-24 u-font-family-accent-fancy lrv-u-font-weight-normal lrv-u-color-grey lrv-u-margin-l-050 lrv-u-line-height-small">$90</span><span class="c-span discount-price u-font-family-accent-fancy lrv-u-text-transform-capitalize lrv-u-font-style-italic lrv-u-color-brand-primary lrv-u-margin-l-050 lrv-u-font-size-20 lrv-u-line-height-normal">50% off</span></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Festival season is coming up, and I know you’re a regular fixture. What are your spring music festival plans? Are you going to Coachella this year?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Honestly, I have no idea as of yet! I don’t think the lineup for Coachella has come out. For me, it’s genuinely about the music, so we’ll see. I haven’t seen any lineups yet, but once I do, I’m sure I’ll figure out the year. But I do love the festival and I do love live music. I feel like I missed out on a lot last year because I was filming.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>And who are you hoping to see on the lineup?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">For headliners, I would say the Radiohead. I’ve seen them headline Coachella, I think twice now. And I’m just obsessed. I’m the biggest Radiohead fan. I love them so, so, so, so, so much! Who else? I mean, I feel like I haven’t seen Megan Thee Stallion yet. That would just be so much fun because we all know the words. We all know the dances. Let’s do them! I would love that. And then maybe if anything was possible, Daft Punk. Get a little rock, a little hip hop, a little electronic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvSoaapqJmjtHDCwKecrKuRYrW2sMaepaxllpbDsL7IrZxmoJWWubW02GaqpqefqbWqsYyrnJyhoJp6o7HArquyZaCnvKXBwq2qZmliaIJ4hJNraGtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
