She didn’t let it get to her as Rose ended up increasing the value of her brand in a wide variety of ways. That being said, WWE has been accused of being ungrateful for firing Mandy Rose after her role in a major event.</p><p>In October last year, the former WWE Superstar lived a tragedy when her&nbsp;<a href=#>older brother Richard passed away aged 40</a>. She would end up missing a few shows due to this but would compete at NXT Halloween Havoc and put on a solid match at the event.</p><p>While speaking on their newly launched podcast&nbsp;<a href=#>Power Alphas</a>, Mandy Rose and her fiance Tino Sabbatelli talked about Rose getting fired from WWE. Sabbatelli accused WWE of being ungrateful for firing Mandy Rose despite the fact she had a tremendous match at Halloween Havoc in the main event and ‘saved’ the show.</p><p>“So in my eyes, WWE was very ungrateful and they tried to do a ruthless act, in my opinion, to you by all of a sudden releasing you, which is crazy because six weeks earlier your brother passed away and you went to perform for them on the biggest pay-per-view. You were the main event and you didn’t ruin their card. But then, six weeks later they kinda forget about that and they release you because you did something that supposedly they didn’t approve of or like.”</p><p>WWE was also accused of urging <a href=#>Mandy Rose to wrestle shortly after her brother’s untimely passing</a>. Mandy Rose also recently made it clear she&nbsp;<a href=#>won’t be returning to professional wrestling anytime soon</a>. Regardless, we’ll have to see what’s next in store for her.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What do you think of this accusation?
