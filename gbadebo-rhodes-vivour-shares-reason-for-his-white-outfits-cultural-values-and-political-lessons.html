I wear white because it symbolises peace. it is part of my brand, especially as a politician. The most important part of it is associated with Lagos, Isale-Eko."<p class=align-left>Speaking about the values <a href=#>Lagos</a> stands for and being a proud son of the soil, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">41-year-old Gbadebo</a> said:</p>"Eko is a land where people value intelligence. That is why it is called the Centre of Excellence. Our forefathers were people who always took pride in excellence and achieving openness in commerce. The state embraces you as long as you are contributing positively to society. Our culture is rich and a lot of the story about Nigeria was pushed in Lagos and by prominent Lagosians."<h2>The impact of colonialism on Nigerians</h2><p class=align-left>In recent times, it has been assumed that some Nigerian parents desire their children to have British accents, and they enrol them in schools where they <a href=#>can</a> learn it. Gbadebo lent his voice to the topic. He stated:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e76dc3f527a23e97.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Major General speaks on implications as FG lists 15 people, BDCs as terrorism financiers</span></p></a>"I think Nigeria, from the point of colonism, we are dealing with an identity crisis. It took former President Olusegun Obasanjo to come in and bring back that pride in our culture and people started wearing native to work and socialise. Before that, everyone was wearing suit and tie. That is the story of a colonised people. They have two identities - of their coloniser and their heritage. I believe our culture is very beautiful and sadly, history is not being taught in schools. So, the value of our history to majority of Nigerians is lost. These are things we need to come back to so that we can have a sense of pride in our culture."<h2>Gbadebo shares lessons as a politician</h2><p class=align-left>Rhodes-Vivour, who has a Bachelor's degree in architecture from the University of Nottingham and <a href=#>a Master's degree</a> in the same field from the Massachusetts Institute of <a href=#>Technology</a> (MIT), shared the lessons he learnt from <a href=#>participating in politics</a>. He said:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c4410a6b33986a60.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"There's no point crying over my son's death", says Herbert Wigwe's father</span></p></a>"Politics has allowed me to build more empathy, having to interact and network with so many people from different social classes and backgrounds. It has exposed me to Lagos in so many different ways and helped me understand what people are dealing with.. It is something that has given me an insight of Lagos and Nigeria at large."<h2>I love cufflinks - Gbadebo admits</h2><p class=align-left>He also shared his favourite <a href=#>fashion</a> accessory, saying:</p>"I don't have any special routine. I just take my bath and I head out and face the day. Due to the fact that most of my clothing is minimal, accessories like cufflinks and rings are what I use to add some vibrancy to my outfits."<p class=align-left>Speaking of the fashion item he can't be caught wearing, he said:</p>"There are those singlets that are like nets. I can't be caught wearing those. I like very dark midnight blue and I also love baby grey. Black also suits me very well. If I am not wearing white, then I am wearing one of those colours."<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a993005524d7b59c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sonnie Badu claims about 78% of gospel musicians and bishops in America are gay</span></p></a><h2>Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour says he has no godfather</h2><p class=align-left><strong>Legit.ng</strong> earlier reported that Gbadebo had <a href=#>debunked the claim </a>that a godfather is sponsoring his political ambition to become the governor of Lagos state.</p><p class=align-left>The Labour Party's governorship candidate for Lagos state said he has no godfather but only mentors and leaders.</p><p class=align-left>According to Rhodes-Vivour, there was no governorship election in Lagos on Saturday, March 18, 2023.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6fmKygmaS7cH2UcWxpbmZitKOtw56ZqGWinbylsdJmraKun6q%2Fbr%2FPnpikq12brrS0yKilZqGem7m2sc2cnKxlk6q5tcHRmqNmrpGhwqa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
