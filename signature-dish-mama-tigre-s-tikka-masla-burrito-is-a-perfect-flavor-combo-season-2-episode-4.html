RENU: It is, it is.
What we've done here is, I've tried to combine a lot of the Indian spices with some of the Mexican spices to get a little bit of a different taste, yet keeping the authentic tikka masala taste."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

SETH: It's going to give it a nice bright flavor now.</p><p>RENU: Just a little bit.</p><p>Just a little bit of brown sugar.</p><p>And then of course, we are going to make a nice blend.</p><p>And so once you have a marinade, that's when you will take your chicken.</p><p>So you want to make sure that each piece is coated well.</p><p>So this is going to marinate for about 24 hours.</p><p>I have some already marinated.</p><p>It's got a lovely color.</p><p>And I'm going to grill some, so let's go to the grill.</p><p>SETH: Let's do it.</p><p>RENU: And this is Serpil, my very efficient and talented line cook.</p><p>SETH: Hi, Serpil.</p><p>RENU: She does... SERPIL: Yeah, hi.</p><p>RENU: And she's going to help us do this burrito.</p><p>SETH: Great.</p><p>So we're actually making a burrito now.</p><p>RENU: We are actually making the signature dish.</p><p>So the first thing we're going to do is, we're going to grill this chicken.</p><p>The grill is nice and hot.</p><p>SETH: I can tell.</p><p>And the grilling will give other layers of smokey flavor.</p><p>RENU: It will, yes.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>And as the chicken marinated, it got a really nice red color.</p><p>So I'm going to flip the chicken now.</p><p>And Serpil here is going to start roasting the onion, green peppers, and the red pepper with cilantro.</p><p>SETH: Whoa.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>I was not expecting such a spectacular show.</p><p>RENU: Yes.</p><p>This is what gives it the nice charred look and the flavor.</p><p>SETH: Yeah.</p><p>RENU: While that is happening, I'm going to be getting my chicken and I'm going to start to slice it.</p><p>I'm going to grill the tortilla, and then we are going to roll the burrito with all the sauces, the tikka masala, and a special cheese sauce that we make right here.</p><p>And then another masala, the house spice, which is our secret ingredient.</p><p>And then you'll enjoy the best burrito ever.</p><p>SETH: Chef, this is definitely a knife and fork burrito.</p><p>I'm not picking this up and taking it to go.</p><p>RENU: It sure is.</p><p>SETH: And what are we drinking here?</p><p>RENU: We are drinking the classic jalapeño margarita that is designed by my husband because he does the bar as I do the back of the house.</p><p>He's an artist and does fantastic margaritas.</p><p>So this is that... SETH: So his specialty is the spicy margarita.</p><p>RENU: The spicy margarita.</p><p>SETH: Cheers to that.</p><p>RENU: Cheers.</p><p>It's good.</p><p>SETH: That is excellent.</p><p>All right, I am ready to get started here.</p><p>RENU: Please.</p><p>I hope you're getting the flavors, the layers, the many, many spices we use to marinate this.</p><p>SETH: That is just awesome.</p><p>RENU: Oh, wonderful.</p><p>SETH: There are so many great flavors, including whatever's on top here.</p><p>RENU: This is a blend that we do here.</p><p>It's a mixture of a couple of spices, but most important is the roasted chili diablo.</p><p>SETH: Got it.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>RENU: It's almost like the chili diablo ash.</p><p>SETH: There's a lot of good smoky flavor throughout the bite.</p><p>RENU: Is the chicken tender?</p><p>SETH: The chicken is tender, but it's just also oozing cheese and just oozing warmth and just comfort.</p><p>RENU: Oh, wow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa7SZ6arn1%2BrtqWxzmikmqWRYsGqs9GeZKloqq%2B9p3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
