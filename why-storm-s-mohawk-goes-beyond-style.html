Oddly enough, the importance of this issue goes beyond merely questions of style.</p><p>When Storm first appeared in 1975’s Giant-Size X-Men No. 1, created by <strong>Len <span data-scayt_word=Wein data-scaytid=3>Wein</span></strong> and <strong>Dave <span data-scayt_word=Cockrum data-scaytid=4>Cockrum</span></strong>, she sported long, flowing hair that served many purposes. It marked her as being traditionally beautiful in the comic book tradition for female characters, while its unrealistic, magical length underscored the character’s ethereal, exotic nature (and, helpfully, magically covered her body when she appeared nude, which happened often in her earliest appearances). Storm’s initial appeal was that of a glamorous self-proclaimed “goddess” who nonetheless remained in the background for the majority of X-Men storylines until the plot required her to contribute in some relatively small way; villains fell in love with her repeatedly to underscore that her beauty was arguably her most important attribute.</p><p>All of which made her makeover in 1983’s Uncanny X-Men No. 173 (designed by artist <strong>Paul Smith</strong>) more dramatic. Unlike other superhero redesigns, Storm’s new look went beyond a simple costume change — although it offered that as well, with the superhero outfit designed by <span data-scayt_word=Cockrum data-scaytid=5>Cockrum</span> in the ‘<span data-scayt_word=70s data-scaytid=7>70s</span> replaced by what was essentially street clothes consisting of a leather vest, pants and top.</p><p>The most obvious change, however, was that Storm’s trademark long hair was gone, replaced by a <span data-scayt_word=mohawk data-scaytid=8>mohawk</span>. It wasn’t just fans of the X-Men comic book who were unhappy with the change; other characters were appalled as well. “Your clothes! Your…hair! What have you done?!” exclaims one, while Professor Xavier asks himself whether the change is “indicative of a deeper, more serious metamorphosis.”</p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Blog_Images/Storm.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The answer to that is, of course, yes; the visual upgrade was merely an outward expression of a change in Storm’s personality and outlook that writer <strong>Chris Claremont</strong> had been working on for some time — eight years into her superhero career, it would have been unrealistic for her to be quite as forgiving and naive about the world as she had been initially, after all, and the second Storm was harder, stronger and perhaps a little more suspicious of the world than when she first appeared. The <span data-scayt_word=mohawk data-scaytid=10>mohawk</span> and outfit change was merely a visual signifier to underscore that this was no longer the character as she had debuted — a fact underscored when, a year later, she lost her superpowers.</p><p>It also was a sign of things to come; at least for the remainder of Claremont’s time writing X-Men (He stayed with the series for 17 years, and remains one of its core writers in the eyes of most of comic book fandom); when Storm went through a shift in status or personality, her hair would change. When she regained her powers, her hair returned to a longer style that was closer to her original appearance, albeit bigger in a style befitting the late <span data-scayt_word=1980s data-scaytid=12>1980s</span>; when she was kidnapped and brainwashed by villains, her head was shaved bald — perhaps <span data-scayt_word="Shipp's" data-scaytid=13>Shipp’s</span> tweet was a hint that fans should expect that storyline in Apocalypse — and so on.</p><p>In recent years, Storm has returned to the <span data-scayt_word=mohawk data-scaytid=53>mohawk</span>, with writer <strong>Sam <span data-scayt_word=Humphries data-scaytid=15>Humphries</span></strong> embracing the character’s hair subtext. “I wouldn’t have [brought the look back] if it didn’t reflect a change in [Storm]’s inner life,” he <a href=# rel=nofollow>explained in an interview at the time</a>. “As excited as I am for the <span data-scayt_word=mohawk data-scaytid=16>mohawk</span>, I’m more excited about what it means for her as a character.”</p><p>When teasing that her Storm will break away from the long-haired look favored by <strong>Halle Berry</strong> in earlier X-Men movies, <span data-scayt_word=Shipp data-scaytid=59>Shipp</span>&nbsp;is not merely suggesting a visual break from the way the character’s appeared onscreen; she’s also hinting that, perhaps, this Storm will differ from what movie audiences have come to expect as well.</p><p>X-Men: Apocalypse will be released May 27, 2016.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLl5zJ6lZq%2BYrnq0wM6rpKxlnaS1osPKZm9paWFmg3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
