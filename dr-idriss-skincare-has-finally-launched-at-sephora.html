Arnica, which you probably know as an ingredient employed to help prevent bruising. “Arnica can also improve circulation, so it can reduce swelling due to vasular congestion,” notes Dr. Finney.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to try out the brand’s products for yourself, scroll ahead to shop the entire range through Sephora.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

Originally from Pittsburgh, PA, Dr. Finney completed his undergraduate and medical degrees at Pennsylvania State University. He completed his internship and dermatology residency at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, PA, where he served as chief resident during his final year. Following his residency, he completed an advanced fellowship in aesthetics, hair restoration, and skin surgery with renowned hair surgeon Dr. Marc Avram in New York City. Dr. Finney approaches aesthetics holistically, taking into account not only patients' current concerns, but also planning for the future. He takes pride in establishing longitudinal relationships, educating his patients on the 3D-nature of aging, and ultimately ensuring a future of aging gracefully. His goal is to ensure that his patients look refreshed, never “done”. As a hair expert, Dr. Finney continues to push the standard of care, and innovates to create cutting edge, individualized treatment plans. He has been treating his own genetic hair loss since his mid-20s; therefore, he is truly able to view each treatment through the lens of the patient and provider. This is what led him to create his ScalpStim Pro treatments: efficacious, customized treatments for his patients.Dr. Finney has authored several peer-reviewed articles and book chapters on hair loss. He frequently lectures both nationally and internationally on the topic, leading him to be sought after by major media outlets to share his expertise re: skin and hair. Dr. Finney takes pride in helping mold the next generation of dermatologists, acting as clinical assistant professor at Mount Sinai - Icahn School of Medicine. When not seeing patients, Dr. Finney loves reading historical non-fiction, and staying active playing ice hockey, hiking or competing on Peloton.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4gs5wjUoPKqjLLLNHcwPRe-1920-80.jpg><span class=person__name>Dr. Shereene Idriss</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Board Certified Dermatologist<p>Shereene Idriss, M.D. is a board-certified dermatologist and an expert in facial rejuvenation, as well as minimally invasive body contouring. After graduating magna cum laude from the seven-year Medical Honors Program at The George Washington University, Dr. Idriss completed a research fellowship at Harvard University, and finalized her dermatology training at Tufts Medical Center in Boston before relocating to New York City.</p><p>With this philosophy in mind, she has developed and practices a multi-dimensional approach that addresses the major issues associated with aging: volume displacement (i.e. sagging), skin discoloration, loss of inherent elasticity, and textural changes (including wrinkles). She emphasizes understanding the overall needs of her patients and how they feel and perceive themselves inside and out; this allows her to better understand where they are coming from, what they truly want and which procedures will work best for them. She strives to combine a strong doctor-patient connection with her medical expertise, experience with lasers and other energy devices, and artistic skills to achieve the best possible aesthetic results and patient care.</p><p>Dr. Idriss is currently a Clinical Instructor in Dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and before that she was a Clinical Assistant Professor of Dermatology at NYU. Dr. Idriss is also a fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology, the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, the Dermatologic Society of Greater New York, and the Women’s Dermatologic Society. She has published several research papers including award-winning publications on the evolution of dermatology in the digital age, which have set the foundation of her #PillowtalkDerm series on YouTube and Instagram</p><p>In a world amped up on filters, Dr. Idriss embraces spotlighting her patients’ unique facial features rather than morphing them into someone else.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJqVlsK1xY6dqWahlKe2tL%2BMrKKippOWv6Z50p6noaeilnqtrdSnmqFn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
