Eagle-eyed fashion watchdogs behind the popular Instagram account Diet Prada were first to call out the suspiciously fast timing.

Less than 24 hours later, Fashion Nova posted <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/BuC6FOMA1Xc/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="an identical copy" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">an identical copy</a> of the dress retailing for $50. Fast fashion is fast, but is it really that fast?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Eagle-eyed fashion watchdogs behind the popular Instagram account <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/diet_prada/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Diet Prada" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Diet Prada</a> were first to call out the suspiciously fast timing. The account then came in hot with some screenshot receipts suggesting Kardashian may have leaked her borrowed designer look to Fashion Nova before wearing it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to a screenshot captured from Fashion Nova model Yodit Yemane's Instagram account, photo shoot images of the site's Mugler knockoff were dated February 14, four days before Kim wore the gown in public. Moreover, the original file name of the photos was labeled "Kim dress," though the product name was later dubbed "Winning Beauty Cut Out Gown” on the site.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Diet Prada told BAZAAR.com it was first tipped off to the suspicious activity when all Kylie Jenner's 21st birthday party looks were copied on Fashion Nova within hours of Jenner stepping out. A later Instagram caption from Kim asking "fast fashion brands, can you please wait until I wear this in real life before you knock it off?" added fuel to the fire, "Her [Kim's] glib attitude towards Missguided in her caption for the gold Yeezy dress seemed fishy...especially considering it’s a knockoff of her husband’s work and he apparently wrote her a $1,000,000 check to turn down a fast fashion collab," Diet Prada said.</p><img alt="Clothing, Dress, Cocktail dress, Shoulder, Fashion model, Strapless dress, Neck, Fashion, Joint, Glitter, " title="Clothing, Dress, Cocktail dress, Shoulder, Fashion model, Strapless dress, Neck, Fashion, Joint, Glitter, " width=1000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-kylie-embed-1550693666.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Fashion Nova/Instagram @KylieJenner</span><p>Just one of many looks Fashion Nova recreated from Kylie Jenner’s 21st birthday party—the next day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After the allegations of peddling her looks to Fashion Nova, Kim took to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/KimKardashian data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Twitter class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Twitter</a> to defend herself, putting the onus on fast fashion companies. In a string of tweets, she called the knockoffs "devastating" and concluded by saying, "I don’t have any relationships with these sites. I’m not leaking my looks to anyone, and I don’t support what these companies are doing."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Could sites like Fashion Nova and Missguided just be extremely fast in shooting their replicas? Diet Prada tells BAZAAR.com: "It’s possible, but the date stamp on the file names of the images from the shoot are telling. Both Kris and Kylie Jenner have also already officially partnered with Fashion Nova, so the family connection is there."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If Kim is secretly leaking her designer outfits to fast fashion sites ahead of time, are there legal implications? It's complicated, but Julie Zerbo, attorney and founder of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.thefashionlaw.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Fashion Law" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">The Fashion Law</a>, says it's technically legal, "I don't know of any embargo on the imagery of borrowed or lent designer looks, so I don't think there would be a contract issue."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It could, however, be an issue if Kim does in fact have a secret deal with Fashion Nova or Missguided. "If there is a partnership of some kind, then that would need to be disclosed by both the celebrity endorser and the brand itself,” Zerbo explains.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another potential red flag: "What might be an issue is if Kim and Fashion Nova or Misguided are working together to create these looks in connection with her posting something on Instagram, like ‘fast fashion companies please don’t copy this look’ and mentioning a specific one and then that specific one turning around and promoting it on Instagram. That is very likely one of the 'material connections' that the Federal Trade Commission would be hoping to see disclosed for the benefit of consumers,” Zerbo adds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Strangely enough, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/missguided/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Missguided's Instagram" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Missguided's Instagram</a> post, doing exactly what Zerbo describes, was later deleted from its page after copying Kim's gold Yeezy dress.</p><img alt="Clothing, Fashion model, Shoulder, Dress, Leg, Fashion, Joint, Footwear, Cocktail dress, Formal wear, " title="Clothing, Fashion model, Shoulder, Dress, Leg, Fashion, Joint, Footwear, Cocktail dress, Formal wear, " width=750 height=562 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/5c5dea2f74c5873ccc49f32b-750-562-1550696406.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Screenshot via Business Insider</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ultimately, one has to ask why Kim, who has worked hard to be taken seriously in the fashion world, would jeopardize her designer connections for the sake of a Fashion Nova partnership? Diet Prada speculates that because "Kim is the queen of monetizing her physical appearance, it makes sense that the rewards of a fast fashion partnership would outweigh the risk. In this case, she probably got the dress from an archival fashion dealer and thought it was fair game as opposed to knocking off a contemporary designer who created something custom for her, or is currently selling on the market. I think she may have underestimated how beloved Thierry Mugler’s work is."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/765453da-3fc9-4650-8bff-01664371711e_1704808979.png alt="Headshot of Lauren Alexis Fisher" title="Headshot of Lauren Alexis Fisher" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Lauren Alexis Fisher is the Senior Editor at Cosmopolitan, overseeing digital content across fashion, lifestyle, beauty, sex, and culture.
