If it would mean a great deal to her, or if she's including your sister in her bridal party, it's probably worth honoring her brother with the title of groomsman.<h2>Do siblings walk down the aisle?</h2>Walking the Bride Down the Aisle<p>Traditionally, the father of the bride walks the bride down the aisle. Now, you can have anyone who is special walk you down the aisle – brother, uncle, cousin, your children, your sister, you Maid/ Matron of honor, or maybe even both parents.</p><h2>Should you ask the groom's sister to be a bridesmaid?</h2>Are you automatically expected to ask your fiancé's sister to be a bridesmaid? The short answer to whether or not you have to include anyone, even a family member, in your wedding party is no. This is your wedding, and you and your partner should do whatever feels right.<h2>Should the brides brother be in the wedding?</h2>There are no rules that say that siblings have to be in the bridal party.

If someone you're considering doesn't fit that bill, they probably shouldn't be your maid of honor.<h2>Does your maid of honor have to be your sister?</h2>There's no rule stating you absolutely must make your sister your maid of honor—or even include her in your bridal party at all.<h2>What does the maid of honor pay for?</h2>The maid of honour and the rest of the bridal party are expected to cover all wedding attire costs. This includes the dress (plus any necessary alterations), shoes, and any jewellery you'll be wearing the day of.

Some brides we know have even choose their grandmothers. As far as feeling awkward next to the younger bridesmaids: You shouldn't!<h2>What does the groom's sister do?</h2>The recommendations range from the fairly traditional (she can perform a reading at the ceremony or light a unity candle) to the decidedly more modern (she can be groomswoman and stand with her brother during the ceremony).<h2>Can I have 2 chief bridesmaids?</h2>Having two maids of honor is perfectly fine … and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. After all, this is YOUR wedding day. You make the rules and can plan your day however you want. If you want to have twenty bridesmaids, go for it.<h2>Can I not invite my brother to my wedding?</h2>Dear Estranged: You can decline any invitation, but when you ask whether you are “obligated” to attend your brother's wedding, the answer is yes. A wedding is not an invitation to the movies. It is a major life-chapter in the story of a family, and because you are the groom's sibling, you should attend.<h2>How many bridesmaids is too many?</h2>A wedding can have quite literally any number of bridesmaids. Some brides have no maids at all, whereas others might have several dozen. The most common number of bridesmaids is 3, but anywhere between 1 and 12 is considered a perfectly normal amount.<h2>How many bridesmaids is normal?</h2>On average, you'll find that most brides choose to have between 4 to 6 bridesmaids .

As the groom's mother is escorted to her seat, her husband will follow along behind.<h2>Who walks down aisle first at wedding?</h2>Partner #1 and Parent(s) Partner #1 walks down the aisle escorted by their parent(s).
