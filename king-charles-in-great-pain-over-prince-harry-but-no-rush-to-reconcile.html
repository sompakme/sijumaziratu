King Charles’ ‘undeniable anger’ over Harry
The subject of Prince Harry is one that brings King Charles “great pain,” with Daily Mail royal editor Rebecca English—in a feature profiling Charles as he turns 75 this week—quoting a source as saying there is “barely any level of communication” between Charles and Harry."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But sticking to his guns, he has rejected Harry’s demands for an ‘apology’ and put the whole issue to one side for the time being as he concentrates on the business of state.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop><p>A source tells the paper: “It’s very sad His Majesty doesn’t get to see his son or his grandchildren, but there’s no rush to patch things up.”</p><p>Elsewhere, we learn, among other things, that Charles does the same Canadian Airforce exercises as <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>his father</a> did every morning to stay in shape, skips lunch, and spends plenty of time apart from <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Queen Camilla</a>, with both liking a bit of me-time at their own houses.</p><p>There are also some interesting insights into his relations with his sons. One source says: “While I am sure they still don’t agree on everything all the time, he and the <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Prince of Wales</a> are firmly united now around a common shared interest, which is to keep the institution in a place where it can serve the nation. This was happening anyway as the late queen got older, but there’s no doubt what happened with <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Harry</a> brought everything into sharp relief.”</p><p><b>King Charles leads memorials to war dead</b></p><p>King Charles led <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Remembrance Sunday commemorations</a> in the U.K. Sunday for the second time as king.</p><p>In a somber ceremony at Central London’s principal war memorial, the Cenotaph, Charles laid a wreath of poppies, followed by his son <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Prince William</a>, his brother Prince Edward and his sister <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Princess Anne</a>. <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Prince Andrew</a>, who was forced to step back from royal duties after being accused of sexual assault by <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Jeffrey Epstein</a> victim <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Virginia Giuffre</a>, was not present (although Charles is understood to have <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>spent time with Andrew yesterday</a> on a pheasant shoot at Windsor which Edward also attended).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Camilla and <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Kate Middleton</a> looked on from a balcony in a government office overlooking the memorial. Kate wore a Catherine Walker overcoat, with military-style detailing.</p><p><b>Prince William’s big China plan</b></p><p>Prince William is planning to take his environment-focused Earthshot Awards to China, <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>the U.K. <i>Sunday Times</i> reports</a>, “in an attempt to engage with the country and fast-forward change to its environmental policies.”</p><p>William’s bold move comes in the same week as he questioned how the royals performed their duties, and challenged his father for headlines with the Earthshot Awards taking place on the same day as the State Opening of Parliament—earning a rebuke from some friends of the royals <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>talking to The Daily Beast</a> who cautioned William against arousing his father’s jealousy.</p><p>Charles has never visited mainland China “because of his views on the regime’s treatment of Tibet and its human rights record. By comparison, William is said to believe that you ‘can’t exclude a big chunk of the planet when thinking about fighting for its future,’” the paper reports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>A royal source told the <i>Times</i>: “Prince William believes that when it comes to the climate and the environment, Asia is critical. He’s of the view you can’t exclude a big chunk of the planet when thinking about fighting for its future. To fast-forward the change and impact he wants, he knows he has to engage with China and India — two of the world’s biggest economies and biggest emitters of carbon dioxide.</p><p>“This is not him commenting on government policy. This is about his approach to the environment and ability to create real global change. It is him thinking, ‘Where can I deliver impact and change not just here but around the world?’ That is his longer-term view.” A Kensington Palace spokesman said: “Scale and ambition is something the prince thinks a lot about. He wants to make Earthshot truly global.”</p><p><strong>Charles and Camilla unveil regal statues</strong></p><p>King Charles and Queen Camilla unveiled new statues of his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth, and Prince Philip at London’s Royal Albert Hall on Saturday. The figures, designed by sculptor Poppy Field, stand in the venue’s South Porch, and Charles unveiled them before attending the annual Festival of Remembrance. Also in attendance: Queen Camilla, Prince William and Kate Middleton, Prince Edward and his wife Sophie, and Princess Anne and her husband Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong><b>Inside William</b>’s<b> laid-back style</b></strong></p><p>Prince William could never be accused of being a fashion slave, but he generally looks unremarkably OK, which is probably just the way he likes it. The key to his unthreatening success is, partly, the work of Italian designer Luca Faloni whose eponymous brand is fast becoming one of William’s favorites.</p><p>In an interview with the <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>British <i>Sunday Times</i></a>, Faloni says: “A few years ago one of my customers, who is a keen polo player and moves in certain circles, sent us a picture of Prince William and asked, ‘Is he wearing your shirt?’”</p><p>Faloni then “saw the prince on TV on a tour of southeast Asia and said, ‘Wait a second, I think he is wearing our shirts.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Then the ultimate nod; William was wearing a Faloni cashmere sweater and denim shirt made on one of William and Kate’s family Christmas card photos.</p><p>Faloni tells the<i> Sunday Times</i>: “They don’t want to be flashy. If you’re Prince William, you don’t want 60 million people in England to know that you bought a £10,000 jacket from an expensive brand. You look for something that is discreet and classic…It’s classic but different—without going crazy.”</p><p><b>This week in royal history</b></p><p>It’s King Charles’ 75th birthday this week. He was born on November 14, 1948 at Buckingham Palace. To mark the occasion, he has been photographed by photographer Rankin <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>for the cover of <i>The Big Issue</i> magazine</a>. In an article for the publication, Charles writes about the Coronation Food Project, which he launched to tackle food insecurity and waste.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><b>Unanswered questions</b></p><p>Will King Charles and Prince Harry reconcile?
