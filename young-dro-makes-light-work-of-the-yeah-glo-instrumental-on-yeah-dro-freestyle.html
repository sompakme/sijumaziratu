The Memphis femcee was losing some steam after dropping tracks like "F.N.F." and "Tomorrow 2". At least, that was the narrative amongst most fans, but she really shut up a lot of skeptics with that February single. It has become one of the genre's anthems of the year, as it preaches self-worth and being confident in your abilities. Because of its message and lively performance, the track has been <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">widely praised</a> by many, including other rappers. One of them is <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Dro</a>, who has recently decided to rap over the instrumental and retitle it "Yeah Dro Freestyle".</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Young Dro is a veteran wordsmith and has been an unheralded name in the Atlanta scene for well over a decade and a half. The "Shoulder Lean" MC is not as eager to drop much anymore it seems, as it evidenced by his last project dropping in 2022. That would be Da Real Atlanta & HyDROponic (Deluxe Edition). Furthermore, his last singles came back in 2023. But, after almost five full months, Young Dro is back with the "Yeah Dro Freestyle".</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-yeah-dro-freestyle-by-young-dro>Listen To "Yeah Dro Freestyle" By Young Dro</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It is only available on his YouTube page, which features just this one song. Even though he has received minor publicity on the platform, the off-the-dome performance has over 100,000 views. Dro shows off his always impressive flows and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">wordplay</a> across the 2:48 of runtime.
