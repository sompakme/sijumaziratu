The Compton native was joined at the ceremony by Xzibit, 50 Cent, his longtime friend Snoop Dogg and his protégé Eminem.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Later, at the close of his segment on Kimmel’s Tuesday show, Dre dropped the announcement about Eminem’s forthcoming album.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Eminem is working on his own album, which is coming out this year. He said it was OK for me to make an announcement right here on the show,” said Dre, who has a production credit on some of the album’s tracks. “I’m actually going to get the entire album for the first time tomorrow … I haven’t even heard anything complete that I’ve done, but I’m going to hear it and he’s putting out an album in 2024.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">This new release will be Eminem’s 12th studio album, following 2020’s Music to Be Murdered By. That album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming Eminem’s 10th consecutive album to achieve this feat. Dre brought the rapper to national attention by signing him to a major label deal and producing his 1998 breakout hit, “My Name Is,” and two other tracks on the Detroit-native’s debut record.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Four years later, Dre played the same mentor role to another protégé, rapper 50 Cent, who also joined him on Kimmel on Tuesday with Snoop Dogg, the rap mogul’s longtime friend and collaborator. The two told Kimmel’s audience stories of their years working with Dre, from ’90s hits from Dre’s debut masterpiece, The Chronic in 1992, through 50 Cent’s Dre-produced “In da Club” over a decade later, and their appearance together at the 2022 Super Bowl Halftime Show.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Dre began his career as a founding member of gangsta rap group N.W.A and later was a central figure in West Coast G-funk hip-hop. The release of The Chronic catapulted him to the top of the rap game as an artist and president of Death Row Records. He went on to found Aftermath Records and become one of the rap genre’s most sought-after producers in the 2000s. He then had a second act as founder and <a href=# rel=nofollow>CEO</a> of <a href=# rel=nofollow>Beats Electronics</a>, which was bought by Apple six years after its debut for $3.4 billion. In the past decade, Dre has also focused on philanthropy, donating $70 million to USC to create a new academy there, and $10 million to Compton High School.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2BZv26w0Z5kp52nYrKutc2epGaZnJfCrnmRaWltZWFngHaElG9samlf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
