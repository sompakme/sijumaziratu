Sometimes, your skin is rough and needs to be exfoliated, and sometimes, it's dry and needs extra hydration."</p><p>That said, if you have a preexisting skin condition or a history of irritation, you should check with your dermatologist before experimenting. But if your doctor is on board and you're craving a bit of creativity, check out these homemade body scrub recipes, courtesy of dermatologists and estheticians, that will give you the ultimate summer glow.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-exfoliating-coffee-scrub><span>The Exfoliating Coffee Scrub</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bc26SP5VDmbLFuMPrCXXyH-1920-80.jpg><p>If you're dealing with dead, dull skin or ingrown hairs, you may benefit from exfoliation. In particular, I like exfoliating my legs in the mornings and shaving them in the evenings (doing both during the same shower could cause irritation). If you're looking to mimic that routine, consider a coffee scrub, which both exfoliates skin and boasts that coffee smell that's sure to wake you up.</p><p>"In our opinion, the best body scrubs are made from coffee and honey," says esthetician and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://atelierbeautebk.com/about-us/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>co-founder of Atelier Beauté, Aneta Zuraw.</u></a> "Coffee peeling exfoliates dead skin cells, smooths and firms the skin, while honey takes care of moisture.

However, this can further irritate acne, or it can cause dryness, which only makes your skin ramp up oil production, exacerbating your acne. Therefore, if you're struggling with body acne, look for ingredients—like the ones in this face mask—that provide balance.</p><p>"The exfoliating aspect of this scrub comes from almonds, which are rich in both vitamin E and antioxidants,” says Dr. Shamban. "Plus, unlike some harsh scrubs, which irritate the skin and cause an overproduction of oil, this one uses olive oil and avocado to prevent that dryness, making it especially great for people with oily backs or shoulders."</p><p><strong>To make an almond scrub:</strong></p><li>Using a coffee grinder or food processor, grind 1/3 cup of almonds into a rough powder. You could also finely chop the almonds by hand.</li><li>Combine 1/2 cup of olive oil with half an avocado (which contains vitamins B, C, E, and K) in a food processor until smooth.</li><li>Mix the almonds and the avocado mash in a bowl or jar, then add two tablespoons of&nbsp;witch hazel&nbsp;(an astringent loaded with antioxidants).</li><li>Smooth the resulting product over your skin, paying extra attention to oil-prone areas. Be sure to avoid the face!</li><li>Rinse skin with warm water, dry with a soft towel, and be sure to follow up with a moisturizer.</li><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-healing-salt-scrub><span>The Healing Salt Scrub</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U4yYcB5cUZt79vnpVeFoGR-1920-80.jpg><p>This DIY is a double whammy, thanks to its hero ingredient Epsom salt, which acts not only as a gentle exfoliant but also as a tried-and-true muscle relaxant.</p><p>“Epsom salts are high in magnesium sulfate, which directly relaxes muscle aches and pains,” says Dr. Shamban. The recipe also calls for green tea—one of the best antioxidants on the market, she adds—and lavender oil to create an incredibly relaxing and soothing body formula.</p><p><strong>To make a salt scrub:</strong></p><li>Combine 1/4 cup of olive oil, five drops of pure essential lavender oil, three teaspoons of Epsom salt, and one teaspoon of green tea in a bowl or jar.</li><li>Mix the ingredients until you’ve created a paste-like consistency.</li><li>Massage across skin, avoiding the face, and rinse with warm water when you're done.</li><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-experts><span>Meet the Experts</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg><span class=person__name>Dr. Ava Shamban, M.D.</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=LINKEDIN><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Board-certified dermatologist<p>Dr. Ava Shamban is a board-certified dermatologist passionate about helping her patients feel their best.
