I don’t think there’s ever a bad time to do that, it’s just that we usually take [those things] for granted. [The show is] not about now, but I think it might resonate even more. I hope people are in the right frame of mind to enjoy it, and maybe it’ll make them feel a bit better. But it’s still entertainment. It’s not life-changing, it’s not a lecture – it’s still a sitcom, it’s just about a very, very important issue."&nbsp;Ricky is best known for his starring roles in&nbsp;and&nbsp;and well as his films&nbsp;and&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">After Life | Season 2 Official Trailer | Netflix</a><p style=text-align:center id=egRbDtkBVKM- data-wc=6><strong>WATCH: After Life season two trailer</strong></p><h2>Ashley Jenson - Emma&nbsp;</h2><p id=eyiEHDNgRPhV data-wc=56>Ashley has worked with Ricky before, having co-starred as Maggie in the hugely popular sitcom,&nbsp;The actress has also starred in&nbsp;and&nbsp;In After Life she plays Emma, a kindly nurse who looks after Tony's father in a care home.
