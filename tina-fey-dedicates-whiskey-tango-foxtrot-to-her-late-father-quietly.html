Donald Fey, who was a Korean War veteran and a professional writer for more than 30 years, died of heart failure on Oct. 18 — just as directors John Requa and Glenn Ficarra were editing the dark comedy. It stars Fey as journalist Kim Baker, a dissatisfied American news copy producer who heads to wartime Afghanistan as a foreign correspondent."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Fey noted that “it reminds people that Afghanistan is still happening, and that people are still suffering over there,” and co-star <a href=# id=auto-tag_margot-robbie data-tag=margot-robbie>Margot Robbie</a> said she admires “such a big leap of faith and tried something new — that’s grows you as a person.”</p><p>Kim Barker, the film’s real-life subject and author of the original book, is thankful the adaptation isn’t “Anchorman in Afghanistan,” but so much more.</p><p>“This is a different kind of movie for strong women — it shows women actually following their dreams,” she said on the red carpet, alongside her wartime team members in attendance. “If I had ended up, at the end of this movie, married and holding a baby, I would’ve punched this movie.”</p><p>Paramount Pictures releases&nbsp;Whiskey Tango Foxtrot&nbsp;in theaters on March 4.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLW1zZpkn52pYrGmsMicmK2do2LEqbXSpJyyZaSWu6i7jHFtcnFja3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
