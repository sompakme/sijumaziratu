Moreover, some fans think that his latest Instagram Story is actually targeting rival. This is due to what Drizzy is wearing in the "fit pic": a sweatshirt of Compton Community College, where K.Dot's wife reportedly (and allegedly) attended, and chains that (allegedly) are or at least resemble Tupac Shakur's. No caption, no song attached: just a mirror selfie. That'll definitely show him...</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, what was once the most exciting and potentially expansive hip-hop "civil war" the genre's seen in decades now turned into a coup d'état... on both ends. On one hand, you have the "20 versus 1" against Drake, which he's been able to effectively dismiss despite <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Metro Boomin</a>, and company's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">attempts to unite to "take him down."</a> On the other, there's Kendrick Lamar's lack of response, and how much of the rap community now doubts if he can "hold the crown" if he can't clap back in a beef he technically started. But it's fair to say that, for rap fans with no horse in this race, both outcomes have been disappointing to some degree.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-s-latest-alleged-kendrick-lamar-troll>Drake's Latest (Alleged) Kendrick Lamar Troll</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For one, Drake's consistent trolling of Kendrick Lamar is starting to backfire at least a little bit, as putting all this energy with no response is really putting him in a <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>50 Cent</a> antic category that he was right on the border of. Add onto that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a removed diss track that used Tupac and Snoop Dogg's A.I. voices</a> and you've got plenty of reason as to why hardcore rap nerds, casual fans, and the industry at large is either feeling skeptical about this approach or mostly interested in the spectacle of it all. Of course, the Compton lyricist's lack of response is patient and somewhat confusing, but above all, it speaks volumes as to his confidence in his superiority and his refusal to play into social media bait. But it's also harder to swallow when he's been wanting this for years.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, with rumors that this was all to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">promote a supposed new album</a> from the pgLang creative, that would certainly be a sad reality to cope with that many fans are fearing right now. If all the smoke is for marketing or to give yourself a boost, weren't there less combative, incendiary, or genuine ways of building hype? It's clear that the only thing that can get things back on track is a response, or at least something from Mr. Morale, but it's definitely been an interestingly bizarre dynamic to witness. On that note, come back to HNHH for more news and the latest updates on Kendrick Lamar and Drake.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnboFxf49mm6uZm5p6rLHNnamim5tiuaK5wKtkm52Vm3q1vs6lo2ahnqjBorPRmqRmoJmleqm7z2alnq%2Bj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
