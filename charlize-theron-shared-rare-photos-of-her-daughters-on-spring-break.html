In what may be proof that Theron is otherworldly, she managed to look picture-perfect on an attraction, even as her daughter screamed while strapped into a lightcycle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Spring break mode activated," she captioned the carousel.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2018, Theron&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>spoke about adoption</a>&nbsp;and how she always knew that it would be how she would grow her family. She credited her upbringing in South Africa and working with orphanages as to why she feels drawn to adoption.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Even when I was in relationships, I was always honest with my partners. That adoption was how my family would look one day,” she said. “This was definitely not a second option for me. It was always my first.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Instagram/CharlizeAfrica</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Theron recently opened up about motherhood during Breitling's Navitimer cocktail party in New York City, saying that having a daughter in middle school — complete with middle-school emotions — wasn't something she could prepare for.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My oldest just went to middle school and it was literally, it was so sad. I was like, 'Where's my baby?'" Theron said, according to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. "And she was like, 'Mom, please don't look, Mom, don't hug me.' I was like, 'Can I hug you?' She's like, 'No, no.' Oh my god. It's like a whole different game."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There's something about having kids that you're so aware of the changes that come, and they happen really fast, and it's just a tremendous jump from one year to the other," she continued. "So, it's always exciting to see where they're going to go in the next year."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wqGYq6SZr7JuwMeeqaimXZmutrPHrZyrq12ovbO1zaBkm6qVlrhutc2sq5qfopa6brDIrKWesV2svLO4w2Zvb2phaH54</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
