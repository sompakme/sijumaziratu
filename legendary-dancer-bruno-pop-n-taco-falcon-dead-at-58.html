For those who may not be familiar with the man, he was best known for being an incredible dancer who was a pioneer in the breakdancing world. He helped popularize the pop and lock, and as it turns out, his talents were able to land him roles in big films.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For instance,&nbsp;Bruno was in the movie "Breakin'" with Ice T. The rapper-actor was one of the first people to comment on Bruno's passing, saying "Yep, just got a text. He was to young. Smh."&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As TMZ noted, Bruno was also one of the dancers in Michael Jackson's iconic "Smooth Criminal" video. He even taught MJ some of his moves, and there is no doubt that the dancer was a big influence on Jackson as he served as a choreographer for the superstar's HIStory tour in the 90s. Needless to say, Bruno's impact is palpable, and many are about to be educated on what he did for dancing and music as a whole.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It was reported that there is no exact cause of death for Bruno, however, his sister Diana Wolgamott believes he died of a heart attack in his sleep.&nbsp;With natural causes believed to be at play here, there will not be an autopsy.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">You can see Bruno's iconic scene in the film "Breakin,'" down below.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
