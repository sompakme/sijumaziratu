But by the time the series ended, he was in his early 20s. Ready to tackle new acting projects, he moved on to a three-episode arc as Travis Tordjman in the comedy show "What's Up North."</p><p dir=ltr>However, Gould soon found himself at a loose end during quarantine, which he treated like a six-month holiday. However, he admitted that this, coupled with a diet that exclusively consisted of pizza, was not helping him feel his best, so he decided to invest in his health. "I feel like now it's time to kind of make a decision on where I want to go with my career, and one of the ways you can do that is by changing my look and my mindset," the actor told <a href=#>People</a>&nbsp;in 2021. <a href=#>Gould transformed himself</a> physically and mentally with the help of a close friend, who became his personal trainer. Together, they did a socially distanced workout every day, which left Gould with a lot of fitness goals, like rock climbing at Yosemite.</p><p dir=ltr>When it was finally time for Gould to get back to acting, he played college student Chase Sams, who presented with a mysterious illness, on&nbsp;the beloved medical drama "Grey's Anatomy." The role led to other projects, like the 2023 crime drama "Miranda's Victim," which saw Gould share the big screen with the likes of Abigail Breslin, Donald Sutherland, Luke Wilson, Ryan Phillippe, Kyle MacLachlan, and Emily VanCamp.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamthZ4B3go6wn5qsXam1pnnCmqqtZZ%2Bbeq67w56pp2WWlrqquNhmoKxllKS2r7OMp6awZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
