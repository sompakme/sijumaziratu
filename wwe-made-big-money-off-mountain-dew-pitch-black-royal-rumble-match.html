Obviously, this seven-figure payday was worth WWE’s time.</p><p>“Well, you know the thing is that Mountain Dew one, that was a million-dollar deal. That’s significant money if you can get deals like that. It was a really crappy match though and they kept it short. I guess Pepsi has to decide whether it’s worth it to spend a million dollars to sponsor a crappy match, maybe it is. I don’t know, on a pay-per-view that was seen by two million people.”</p><p>Bray Wyatt won that big match, but his story is far from over. The ending saw Uncle Howdy perform a big dive off the equipment in the Alamodome, and then an explosion went off. Only time will tell what happens to LA Knight from this point on.</p><p>For the record, that spot with Uncle Howdy did not come off that well for fans in attendance. <a href=#>You can check out an angle of that dive that WWE doesn’t want you to see here.</a></p><p>Keep checking back with <a href=#>Ringside News </a>for all the information you need about the entire pro wrestling landscape.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this situation with WWE taking sponsorship money?
