I’ve been incredibly lucky to not only have been mentored by incredible women but also to have the opportunity to be a powerful woman at a time when that wasn’t really the norm. And I think all of that enabled me and gave me the strength to really use my voice.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Milano first found the power of using the voice that fame gave her when she agreed to kiss Ryan White, a teenage boy who had contracted AIDS through a contaminated blood transfusion and who had been ostracized at his Indiana middle school, live on television to prove you couldn’t get HIV/AIDS from casual contact.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I went on The Phil Donahue Show and I kissed Ryan. And that was the moment that my life completely changed because I realized what it meant to have a voice by being famous and what it meant to do good with that voice,” Milano recalled.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Milano said she planned to use that voice in her role as a producer and content creator for A+E Studios, with which she has a <a href=#>first-look deal</a> that will see her create and produce projects for all TV platforms in the United States and internationally. The deal also includes a pilot script Milano wrote for Things I’m Seeing Without You, an adaptation of a YA novel by Peter Bognanni.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I’m going to tell love stories, to tell the stories of love in every respect, of love in all its facets and in all its many incarnations. … My passion for writing and producing also comes from a place of love,” Milano said. “And I want to tell stories that are funny, because [finding] humor is important in breaking the tension of fear or nervousness or anger.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Referencing the theme of the 2022 Power Lunch, “Stronger Together,” Milano called on the other women in the room to support each other to help achieve true equality.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I think it wasn’t until maybe #MeToo when we realized how much the patriarchy was fighting against women being together. I think it was all part of the plan to keep us very isolated so that we wouldn’t talk about what they did to us. [I always felt] like men in positions of power made us feel like we were in competition with each other.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Instead of competing, she said, women in entertainment should do what women do naturally when they are out together.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“If you’re out at dinner and your friend says she’s going to use the bathroom, we all go together, right? So why would it be any different going to human resources?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Standing up for women’s rights and equality needs to “become second nature” within the entertainment industry worldwide, Milano said, “so that [in the future] the women’s Power Lunch could also have tables of men who just get it and who are here to support us, because we need them. We can’t find equality and equity without them. [And] that’s why we are stronger together: because I don’t ever want to go through the trauma of being discriminated against as a woman alone again.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Hollywood Reporter’s editorial director, Nekesa Mumbi Moody, echoed that thought, kicking off the luncheon with a call for action.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We’re in a room together, so many dynamic women, so many powerful women,” she said, “And what does that mean to help women in this business, to help us grow together, to be stronger together? I think it means greenlighting each other’s projects. It means mentoring each other. And it also means hiring one another and just being there for one another.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOmqOyq6OWeq61y5qlqGWdmsGwu4ywn6irXam1pnnBqKqsZaKurq951qGgrZ1doraxr86mZGpqY2p%2FdX6VcWpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
