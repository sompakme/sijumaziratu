Steve-O — whose real name is Stephen Glover — asked conservative commentator Patrick Bet-David, who appeared on Club Random recently, about his experience with Maher, particularly about how he felt about the TV personality smoking weed in the room."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s very important that I maintain my sobriety,” said Glover. “I’m about to be sweet 16 [years sober], coming up on it. Really, there’s nothing I value more than my sobriety. There’s nothing more that I protect than my recovery.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He continued, “I found it kind of upsetting when the Bill Maher podcast reached out — and his thing is he smokes pot the whole time while he interviews people. I said, ‘Hey, I’d happily go on there, but while I’m on, out of respect for my sobriety, could he refrain from smoking pot?’ He said, ‘No, that’s a dealbreaker.'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Glover then pointed out that Mike Tyson’s podcast Hotboxin’, which makes a direct reference to smoking weed with its name, respected his sobriety request during his guest appearance. “Be real, all of these prolific potheads … I’ve been on their shows and it wasn’t so important to them to blow marijuana smoke in my face but for Bill Maher, it was a dealbreaker,” he said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The new Wild Ride podcast episode appears to have been filmed a while ago, as Glover celebrated his 16-year sobriety anniversary March 10. He shared the exact date he got sober while speaking with <a rel=nofollow href=#>Louder Sound</a> in 2023. In that interview, Glover explained, “I thought I was a lost cause, a write-off. It just so happened that Johnny Knoxville and some of the people in our Jackass world staged an intervention. They locked me up in a psychiatric ward, and I was locked up long enough and exposed to the right kind of message that I realized, ‘Wow, I have to do something.’ I’ve been sober ever since.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">THR has reached out to Maher for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKO1y6VkppmYmr9uvM6dmpqrpGK%2FprLUrJydZaOkr6a%2BjJ6lr6GipLuusc2tZKyslauybruMamlsbWhrgXiElGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
