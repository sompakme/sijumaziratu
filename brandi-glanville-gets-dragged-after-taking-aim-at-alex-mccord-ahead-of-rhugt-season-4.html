She kicked off her advice search by asking about Brandi simply because Alex was going alphabetically in her quest.</p><p>The IG post got Brandi’s attention, and Alex’s message did not go over well with the RHOBH alum.</p><p>“This b***h ever heard of you tube????? I hope this post got her a few new followers,” Brandi tweeted with a picture of Alex’s Instagram post and message.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brandi Glanville under fire after her response to Alex McCord’s social media post</h2><p>Twitter was buzzing in response to Brandi going after Alex when the latter was just looking for some insight and didn’t throw any shade at all.</p><p>One user called Brandi “exhausting,” while another told Brandi to “calm down.” There was a Twitter user who told the Unfiltered podcast host, “Don’t b rude !!!!!!!! Unprovoked nastiness is never needed,” and a different user reminded Twitter that Brandi “always goes low.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brandi-rude-and-exhausting-responses.jpg><p>Another Twitter user asked Brandi to be nice; after all, she doesn’t even know Alex yet.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Others called out Brandi’s behavior, with one declaring it must be a “wine night” as a different one made it clear this kind of nastiness is why the user doesn’t want Brandi back on<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brandi-nasty-and-mad.jpg><p>Many Twitter users were standing up for Alex, too, including one who referenced Brandi as “unemployed” and acknowledged that Alex has a Ph.D.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Brandi was certainly dragged on social media, including several Twitter users standing up for Alex, pointing out all her accomplishments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Twitter-defends-Alex.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-will-rhugt-season-4-premiere>When will RHUGT Season 4 premiere?</h2><p>Real Housewives fans will be waiting quite a while for Season 4 of RHUGT as filming has yet to begin. The women will be headed to Marrakech, Morocco, to film soon. That means the show likely won’t premiere until later this year or possibly early next year.</p><p>In the meantime, Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip Season 3 still hasn’t hit Peacock airwaves. The season was filmed in Thailand last summer, but a premiere date has not been revealed. Hopefully, that will change soon.</p><p>What do you think of Brandi’s response to Alex?</p><p>Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip Season 1-2 are streaming on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5Knrq%2BwyGaepZmeq7atuMRmnp6so2Kxs63GoJydZZGbwaa%2BjK2YpKGenHqitcxmmK1lkaGyuXnMnJqoqpRirqmxwJ1kqJ5dp7W2s9Nmqp6Zo6S7boCO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
