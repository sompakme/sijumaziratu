In order to build the temple, the I Hemolele chapel had to be moved to a new location. Twenty years later, the I Hemolele chapel burned down in 1940, and the Laie community hosted a <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Hukilau</a> for tourists on Hukilau Beach to raise money to build a new chapel.</p><p>The Laie Hawaii Temple was the first Latter-day Saint temple built outside the continental United States. Previous to 1915, when members of the Church living in Hawaii wanted to attend a house of the Lord, they had to travel almost 3,000 miles to the <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Salt Lake Temple</a> in Utah. Many members from Hawaii chose to move to Utah in order to be close to and receive the blessings of the temple.</p><p>The Hawaiian Saints who moved to Utah settled a city where they lived from 1889-1915. The Saints named this city “Iosepa,” which is the Hawaiian name for “Joseph.” It was named after <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Joseph F. Smith</a>, who served a mission in the Hawaiian islands when he was 15. Later, Joseph F. Smith became Church President and announced a temple to be built in Laie. After the temple was announced, the Saints moved back to Hawaii, leaving Iosepa, Utah, a ghost town. After returning to Hawaii, the Saints named a street near the temple “Iosepa Street,” after the city in Utah where they had lived for the previous 26 years.</p><h2>Historic photos of the Laie Hawaii Temple</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.thechurchnews.com/bs/images/icon-expand.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/e5/18/70522d744b748299f7fb16e0f8e7/2211093.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2>Laie Hawaii Temple Visitors’ Center</h2><p>The Laie temple shares its grounds with the Laie Hawaii Temple Visitors’ Center.
