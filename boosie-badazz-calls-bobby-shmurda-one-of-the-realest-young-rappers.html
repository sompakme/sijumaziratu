Boosie had previously shown his respect for Shmurda's refusal to "snitch" amid his charges. "SOLID AS A ROCK!!" he said in 2019. "It’s a shame how the world don’t glorify the REAL ONES SMH. Rats get mo love then the stand up guys." Shmurda served time for conspiracy to possess weapons and possession of a weapon.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Shmurda recently appeared on The Danza project podcast, where he discussed the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">influence of rap on the younger generation</a>. “These kids are following you guys, and you’re rapping about these f*cking lifestyles…and it’s very dangerous to the communities [because] these little kids [really] think that [it’s] going on, and you did not even live [any] [of] [it],”&nbsp;he explained. The artist went on to say, “Rap is supposed to be telling motherf*ckers to go from negative to positive, coming from poverty to go to riches…and how to stay in that and how to change. That’s the sh*t that I want to hear. I wanna hear about living life…”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-boosie-salutes-bobby-shmurda>Boosie Salutes Bobby Shmurda</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Boosie shared his own message to the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">younger generation</a> last month. “Never become no street n***a,” he told his fans. “Don’t ever become no gangster, bro. Always gotta have n***as with you, always gotta be trying to protect yourself, looking over your shoulder. S**t don’t even be worth it, bro." He went on to say, "You get older you be like, ‘Damn, man.’ Lotta s**t come with this s**t. It’s the only thing that matter, bruh, staying alive. This ain’t the life you want, though, dog. All y’all young n***as out there, this ain’t the life you want.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Last year, Shmurda took to Instagram to share his thoughts on <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">rappers playing "dress-up"</a> with their lifestyles. “I don’t want to be named as a rapper no more, bro,” he explained. "It’s like when you do that rapper sh*t, n****s like try to come for that light. It’s just nasty like these labels is nasty. Look at what they just did to Tory [Lanez]. That sh*t is nasty, my n***a.” He continues, “Then the whole rap community that’s f*cking supporting these n****s. Y’all n****s is disgusting my n***a, cause these the same people that come from saying that they live our lifestyle, they came from our lifestyle. These motherf*ckers is out here playing dress up right now.”</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Caroline Fisher is a News Writer at HotNewHipHop from Chicago, Illinois.
