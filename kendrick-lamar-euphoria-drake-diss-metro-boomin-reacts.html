Furthermore, fans are curious about how those involved in the feud are feeling. For instance, you have none other than <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Metro Boomin</a>, who gave Lamar a platform to strike first on "Like That." As you can see down below, Metro has officially weighed in on the song. However, he isn't exactly giving you a lot of words. Instead, he spammed some laughing emojis to showcase his thoughts on all of this.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kendrick-lamar-euphoria-gets-people-talking>Kendrick Lamar "Euphoria" Gets People Talking</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It is a pretty good response, and one that shows that Metro is, in fact, paying attention right now. The Kendrick response was a very well kept secret, all things considered. Fans had no idea it was going to come out today, on a Tuesday morning. It could have very well dropped over the weekend or even new music Friday. That said, fans are not going to complain. This is exactly what they wanted, as we now have a battle between rap's two biggest artists. Only time will tell who will end up coming through with the win.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you thought of "Euphoria" by Kendrick Lamar, in the comments section down below. Do you believe that this was a worthy response to "Push Ups?" Do you even think that this automatically gives Kendrick the win? Additionally, stay tuned to HNHH for the latest news and updates from around the music world.
