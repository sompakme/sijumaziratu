The carbohydrates in barley are absorbed and converted into glucose gradually, which helps maintain energy without raising blood glucose levels rapidly.&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>Several different barley types are available, but all have a low glycemic index rating. Varieties include:</p><ul><li>Hulless (hulled) barley</li><li>Processed or pearled barley</li><li>Barley kernels</li><li>Rolled barley flakes</li><li>Cracked barley</li></ul><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>The lowest glycemic index variety is found in whole-grain, hulled barley.</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>The below glycemic index and glycemic load data are for 100g of whole-grain, raw barley, which equals approximately &amp;half; cup:³ ⁴</p><p><h3>Glycemic Index</h3></p><p><h3>Serving Size</h3></p><p><h3>Carbohydrate* per Serving (g)</h3></p><p><h3>GL per Serving</h3></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-global.website-files.com/63ed08484c069d0492f5b0bc/65415205d972c16ea84e6738_pexels-mark-stebnicki-2451416-p-500.webp alt sizes="(max-width: 991px) 90vw, 47vw" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=food-h2>Nutritional Facts</h2><p>Barley is packed with nutrients. However, it doubles in size when cooked, so be mindful when reading nutrition labels and measuring portion sizes.</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>The below nutritional information is for 100g of hulled, raw barley, which is equal to approximately &amp;half; cup.⁴</p><p><h3>Calories</h3></p><p><h3>Carbs</h3></p><p><h3>Protein</h3></p><p><h3>Fiber</h3></p><p><h3>Cholesterol</h3></p><p><h3>Vitamins</h3></p><p>A (62.36 µg), B12 (0.04 µg), B6 (0.11 mg), C (12.68 mg), D (1.51 IU).</p><p><h3>Sodium</h3></p><p><h3>Total Fat</h3></p><h2 class=food-h2>Health Benefits</h2><p>Barley is rich in vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial plant compounds that offer numerous health benefits, including:</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-global.website-files.com/63ed08484c069d0492f5b0bc/65415205d972c16ea84e6734_barley-g88dc717e1_640-p-500.webp alt sizes=100vw style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3 class=food-h3>Aids in Blood Sugar Control</h3><p>Due to its low glycemic index and glycemic load, barley is one of the most ideal choices for those looking to manage their blood sugar levels. In one study, ten overweight women who ate barley or oats plus glucose, both oats and barley decreased blood sugar and insulin levels.&nbsp;</p><p>However, barley was much more impactful, reducing levels by between 59 and 65%, compared to only 29-36% with oats.⁵</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>Another study of 10 healthy men found that those who ate barley with dinner had 30% better insulin sensitivity after breakfast the next morning than men who ate refined wheat bread.⁶</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>Finally, a review of 232 scientific studies has linked whole-grain breakfast cereal consumption, including cereals containing barley, to a lower risk of diabetes.⁷</p><h3 class=food-h3>May Improve Digestion</h3><p>The above nutritional information shows that &amp;half; cup of barley contains 17.3 g of fiber, which is 69% and 46% of the recommended daily intake for women and men, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>A diet high in&nbsp;<a href=#>fiber</a>&nbsp;can promote the growth of beneficial bacteria and increase SCFA production. This, in turn, can improve gut health, reduce inflammation, and support metabolic health. In a four-week study of 28 healthy individuals, 60 grams of barley a day increased a beneficial type of bacteria in the gut that may help reduce inflammation.⁸</p><h3 class=food-h3>May Help Lower Cholesterol</h3><p>With 17.3 grams of fiber in a 100g serving, barley is considered a high-fiber food. Fiber can lower cholesterol levels by binding to cholesterol in the intestine and preventing its absorption.⁹</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>In one five-week study of 18 men with high cholesterol, eating a diet with 20% of calories originating from barley lowered total cholesterol by 20%, reduced LDL cholesterol by 24%, and increased HDL cholesterol by 18%.¹⁰</p><h3 class="food-h3 w-dyn-bind-empty"></h3><h2 class=food-h2>Is Barley Good for Weight Loss?</h2><p>Because it is packed with fiber, barley helps reduce hunger and increases feelings of satiety, which may lead to weight loss over time. These impacts occur because barley contains beta-glucan, a soluble fiber. This type of fiber forms a gel-like substance in the gut that slows digestion, curbs appetite, and promotes fullness.¹³ ¹⁴&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>A review of 44 studies found that soluble fiber, such as beta-glucan, are the most effective type of fiber for reducing appetite and food take, which can support weight loss goals.¹⁵ Also, a study from 2015 found that participants who ate at least 30g of fiber per day experienced a sustainable weight loss averaging around two kilograms per year.¹⁶</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>It’s best to spread out your fiber intake throughout your day. Ideally, both soluble and insoluble should be included in every meal (if possible). Consuming a large amount of fiber in one sitting can lead to gastrointestinal discomfort. Assuming you eat three times a day, you should aim to have approximately ten grams of fiber at each meal.</p><h2 class=food-h2>Is Barley Safe for People Living with Diabetes?</h2><p>With a low glycemic index and glycemic load rating, barely is an ideal carbohydrate choice for those living with diabetes. People living with type 2 diabetes may suffer from a magnesium deficiency, a condition that is also related to the onset of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.¹¹ Barley is packed with magnesium and provides 133 mg of this mineral per &amp;half; cup serving of raw, hulled barley.&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>Additionally, barley is rich in beta-glucan, a soluble fiber that helps with digestion. A research study shows that high beta-glucan in barley may help regulate post-meal hyperglycemia in those living with type 2 diabetes.¹²</p><p>Get more information about weight loss, glucose monitors, and living a healthier life</p><p>Thank you!
