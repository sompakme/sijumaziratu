So, when asked about the full-frontal nude shower scene she shares with Williams in the Sarah Polley-directed relationship dramedy, Silverman had no problem giving full-front detail."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It was very supportive, and you forget it once you do it, but the morning leading up to it, I overgroomed,” she shared with a group of reporters. “You know when you even and even and even until nothing’s left? It was bad. Never try to even from the top. Let the top be the top. … It was all right. I wish it was fuller. Michelle’s was so full and awesome.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>VIDEOS: Tribeca Film Festival Red Carpet Interviews</strong></a></p><p>The scene, of course, wasn’t a gratuitous shot designed for titillation; instead, it is simply a frank and unflinching look at what Silverman says is an everyday occurrence.&nbsp;</p><p>“The thing, and I want to be able to say this because Sarah Polley isn’t here, but she always says she wrote that scene because women are naked together all the time,” she said. “You’re in the shower at the Y, or one of you is in the tub and one of you is reading a magazine, you’re hanging out and trying on clothes — it’s such a common, everyday thing for women that’s never reflected in movies. There’s so much nudity in movies, but it’s always sexual.</p><p>“You never see nudity that is not in a sexual way, so this is that,” Silverman continued. “And I’m in it, and ego-wise it’s horrifying, but if I can take myself out of it, I think it’s amazing. It’s jarring. It’s genuinely jarring because it’s not funny, it’s not sad, it’s not dramatic — it’s kind of everyday life.”</p><p>Just as her film works its way from comedy to more serious business matters, the star had no problem shifting gears to politics and some of today’s most contentious social issues.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Full Coverage: Tribeca Film Festival</strong></a></p><p>“Gay marriage is something that Newark Mayor <strong>Cory Booker</strong> said it best: Some things are not meant to be a vote. Some things are a right. And if things like that were left for a vote, he said, I wouldn’t be where I am today — meaning anything that is civil rights,” Silverman said, paraphrasing the charismatic politician. “Because people don’t always know what’s best. Their fears keep them from being open and being fair. And so that would just be not up for a vote. Gay marriage, legal, with a big f—ing apology for the past few years.”</p><p>And while <a href=# rel=noopener>a tweet poking fun at abortion opponents</a> that she posted last week drew some criticism, Silverman remained quite vocal about her support for a woman’s right to choose.</p><p>“It’s a woman’s body. A man would never allow there to be a law telling him what he can do with his body,” she said. “The fact that insurance [doesn’t] want to cover contraception, and yet Viagra is covered by insurance. It’s a joke, and people should be ashamed — and they will be when they look back on it.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLW%2ByJucnJldZ31yfoysmKuZmGLAqrjVnqmmmZ5iu7awxGaqnJ2emnq1rcqeZK2gmah6uK3LrbFmmZKkv7W1zqdkbGlkboR4ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
