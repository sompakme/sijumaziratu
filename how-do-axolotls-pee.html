This is normal, too!<h2>Why is my axolotls tail pointing up?</h2>It may be that your axie is impacted because of it. They sometimes swallow rocks.

If they eat their own poop by mistake, they will do a spit take and scatter bits of poop everywhere! Whether your axolotl makes poop rain or not, you will need to do weekly water changes.<h2>Why is the back of my axolotl floating?</h2>It is not normal for axolotls to float in their tanks because they're amphibians that dwell at the bottom and like to keep their feet on the bottom surface. A floating axolotl is most likely a sign of bloating, impaction, or excess ammonia in the tank.<h2>Do axolotls prefer hard or soft water?</h2>Hard water is noticeable because they cause scaling problems with plumbing/pipework and fittings. Since the axolotl's natural environment is supplied from springs and mountain snowmelt, they require moderately-hard water ranging from 7–14°.<h2>What does chlorine do to axolotls?</h2>Chlorine binds with the oxygen in the blood and reduces it's oxygen carrying capacity. The binding changes the colour of the blood and creates a burnt brown look. This has been anecdotally reported in some axolotls when exposed to chlorinated water.<h2>What is an axolotls life span?</h2>Lifespan – 10-15 years. Colour and characteristics – several known pigmentation types, including brown, black, albino, grey and pale pink; external gill stalks and a caudal dorsal fin as a result of neoteny. Wild population – 700-1,200 approx.<h2>Are albino axolotls rare?</h2>1. Leucistic. Leucistic axolotls are a translucent white with shiny gold flecks, red or pink gills, and dark brown or black eyes. They are very rare in the wild because they are easily spotted by predators, but are one of the most common and beautiful morphs in captivity.<h2>How do you tell if your axolotl is a boy or girl?</h2>The most reliable method of sexing your axolotl (just by looking at them anyway) is to check the area behind their back legs, called the cloaca. In females, the cloaca is more flat against the silhouette of the body with no significant bulge on the sides of the tail.<h2>How often do axolotls poop?</h2>7) How frequently your axie poops is multi-factorial. It depends on your feeding frequency and volume, the water temperature, the axolotl's health status, the diet, its age etc. In general, in healthy axies, i would expect some bowel movement at least once a week.<h2>Does axolotl poop explode?</h2>Axolotls do at lot of pooping. And it's okay if you can fish it out without breaking the sausage skin that the poop is contained in, but if you burst it. Then it will explode into a million pieces and you'll have one hell of a poopy tank.<h2>Can I put my axolotl in the fridge?</h2>Step 3: Fridging the Axolotl<p>Your axolotl will likely not be hungry during fridging, even after a week or two. Because of their slow metabolism, they in addition to a lack of appetite they also experience weight loss much more slowly. The axolotl can stay in the fridge for however long it takes their health to improve.</p><h2>Can axolotls get depressed?</h2>Changes in behavior like that can be evidence of some sort of health issue. I do believe that to some point, all creatures can be 'depressed' if they do not get the stimulation they need.<h2>Why is my axolotl turning white?</h2>Ronnie, gills can go white for numerous reasons. Usually, if an axolotl is sitting very still, they don't need a lot of oxygen. So the blood (which carries oxygen) doesn't flow to the gills in high volumes. So the gills can look pale.<h2>Can an axolotl turn into a salamander?</h2>The tiger salamander and axolotl are related, but the axolotl never metamorphosizes into a terrestrial salamander. However, it's possible to force an axolotl to undergo metamorphosis. This animal looks like a tiger salamander, but the metamorphosis is unnatural and shortens the animals lifespan.<h2>Why is my axolotl thrashing around?</h2>Thrashing is often a sign of discomfort - irritation in the gills, digestive discomfort or constipation, irritation from an injury etc. If you can rule out obvious injury or fungus it could be digestive - they sometimes stand with their belly high off the ground with this too.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8eormacn2KuubvLqKulq12lsqY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
