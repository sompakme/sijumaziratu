Application: Apply immediately to locations where bees have been observed or discovered, together with any additional resting spots, as a residual surface treatment.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is wasp powder a health risk for people to consume?</h3><p>The standard pesticide dust that is used to destroy a wasp nest has a lengthy kill time and, although it is not toxic to humans or other animals, it is not particularly liked by wasps, who avoid it at all costs.</p><p></p><h3>Is it true that tempo dust kills roaches?</h3><p>It is possible to use Tempo Dust to eliminate bedbugs and other pests since it is a ready-to-use pesticide that includes 1 percent cyfluthrin.

This dust has a mild odour and will not discolour clothing or surfaces.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the mechanism of action of wasp dust?</h3><p>It is possible to use insecticidal dusts in these situations because the wasps pick up the dust as they enter the nest and transport it to the centre of the nest. This infects the whole nest, and within a few days, all of the wasps will have died, often within one or two days.</p><p></p><h3>Is it true that pace kills on contact?</h3><p>Take note that Tempo SC Ultra is designed to provide a speedy knockdown of pests; nevertheless, it does not kill the insects immediately after application. The formula does not operate immediately on touch; instead, it acts when the insects consume the deadly amount, which causes the insects to die as a result.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is it okay to spray Tempo throughout the house?</h3><p>Tempo SC Ultra is classified as a general-purpose insecticide and is approved for use both outdoors and inside buildings.

It is mostly due to the fact that they are swiftly broken down in the human body by liver proteins and removed relatively fast that they have such minimal toxicity in humans (see fate in humans and animals section).</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible for tempo to kill spiders?</h3><p>Answer: Yes, Tempo SC Ultra has been designated as a spider killer. Spiders are extremely difficult to control, and while most residual insecticides, such as Tempo SC Ultra, will kill any spider that comes into contact with them, new spiders that enter the area are extremely difficult to control with any insecticide.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible for pace to kill mosquitoes?</h3><p>It is a concentrated pest management product that kills more than 60 species, such as mosquitoes and fleas.
