There's the Da Rocinha series, which is largely tropical (and instrumental), there's the tapes where he produces for another artist, and then there's the North series, where he combines both into a singular statement. North Vol. 1 blended Sango's instrumental prowess with a talented roster of rappers and singers. North Vol. 2 follows suit, while adding some sonic twists. These twists keep the album sounding fresh, albeit wholly familiar.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Sango's usual roster of collaborators is here, and they deliver. Xavier Omar sounds great over the bouncy and surprisingly gritty instrumental for "The Lake." The same goes for <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Smino</a>, who manages to stay atop the busy samba shuffle of "Ice Storm." The chemistry is predictably excellent on these songs, but it's the new collabs that distinguish North Vol. 2 stand out, for better or worse.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A Sango and Channel Tres collab could have gone lots of different ways, but the mood they settle on; jazzy and wistful, with Channel Tres' usual spoken word, makes "Spaceship" one of the best songs on the album. Also worth checking out is Sango and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>GoldLink</a>'s "Peace," which strikes a perfect balance between the former's solo work and GoldLink's weirder impulses. The song would slot in perfectly on Link's 2019 album, Diaspora.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sango-experiments-to-varying-degrees-of-success>Sango Experiments To Varying Degrees Of Success</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Unfortunately, not every collaboration goes over perfectly. "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Masego's Interlude</a>" never really gets off the ground, despite the nice harmony vocals from the titular singer. "Lost Intro (Sango's Version)" is another missed opportunity. Sango tries to hard to fit <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Bryson Tiller</a>'s signature sound, and the result is a generic Tiller song rather than something new. North Vol. 2 isn't perfect, but there are more than enough high points to warrant a listen.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on this brand-new album&nbsp;North Vol. 2&nbsp;by Sango?
